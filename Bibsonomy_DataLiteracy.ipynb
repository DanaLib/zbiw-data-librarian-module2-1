As with many emerging and interdisciplinary fields, data literacy means different things to interested stakeholders and experts.  Rather than trying to produce a definitive explanation of what data literacy means on this site we seek to present resources that depict multiple viewpoints to enable you, the reader, to make your own decisions based on your specific contexts and needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, we strongly believe that librarians have a role to play in data literacy and that the work librarians and others have invested in understanding and responding to information literacy can serve as a foundation for this role. Therefore, we are employing the term \\\"Data Information Literacy\\\" (DIL) on this site to make this connection clear and to keep it at the forefront of the discussion as we define our roles and responsibilities in this space.  \",\n",

In an era of abundant growth of data and supporting infrastructure, proposals for the twinning of information and data science in library and information science schools aim to create expertise which would cater to the job market in need of data-oriented specialists. While data literacy creates the main line of discourse alternative approaches are being considered such as the concept of critical data literacy. A comprehensive thematic analysis of the critical data literacy discourse is undertaken to construct a comprehensive definition of critical data literacy and conceptualize its relation to the general thinking on related concepts. The articles were chosen based on the PRISMA instrument for construction of samples for systematic reviews and when submitted to its eligibility criteria 30 articles remained which were thematically analysed using the MAXQDA software. Our interpretive analysis uncovered five major themes: ontological treatment of data; critique of the epistemological status of data; literacy rationale situated in key problem accentuations; critical pedagogic articulation; and critical data literacy as ethics. We conclude that there is a growing need for terminological clarity in relation to the concepts of data and information considered in the context of the established discourse on critical data literacy.\",\n",

      "      \"description\": \"The 2016 publication of the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy led to extensive discussions in the academic library community on the theories and practices related to information literacy teaching in higher education. In particular, discussions regarding librarians\\u2019 understanding of new critical perspectives on information literacy have come to the forefront. Following a review of the literature on the concept of critical information literacy and library pedagogy, a gap was identified regarding the understanding of information literacy teaching theory and practices in higher education in Canada and, in particular, in the province of British Columbia (BC). In the autumn of 2017, research was conducted to address the question: How are librarians in B.C. higher education applying critical information literacy in their practice? The mixed methods study involved participant librarians drawn from the 25 public higher education institutions in the province who provide leadership for their institution\\u2019s information literacy programmes. The first phase of the research involved a survey which sought information on existing practices and librarian understanding of theory underpinning those practices, with a focus on the concept of critical information literacy. Of the total population of 25 public institutions, 24 survey responses were received from 22 institutions. For the second phase, 13 individuals, representing 13 different institutions (from the total population of 25 institutions), agreed to follow-up, semi-structured interviews. The in-depth interviews were conducted across institution types, sizes, and geographic regions in the province. Information related to awareness and application of theory in practice was gathered. An inductive approach was taken to analysing the qualitative data in both the surveys and the interviews, with the survey data forming the basis for the further exploration of themes emerging from the interviews. Quantitative data related to the particular institutions provided an opportunity to compare and contrast institutions, and to determine whether institution type and location has an impact on the application of critical information literacy in higher education teaching. Themes arising from the research provide an understanding of how and why practices occur as they do, and recommendations for further research and information sharing are identified by the researcher and the participants. Creating a common definition for critical information literacy within the province, and professional development mechanisms that focus on librarian understanding of the theories underpinning critical information literacy, will improve the ability of librarians to work more closely with faculty to teach information literacy across the curriculum.\",\n",

This article describes a significant innovation upon existing competencies by identifying a scaffolding (built upon existing competencies) that moves students progressively from undergraduate training through post graduate coursework and research to post-doctoral work and into the early years of data stewardship. The scaffolding ties together existing research that has been completed in research data management skills and data information literacy with research into the outcomes that are desirable for individuals to present in data management at each of the levels of education. Competencies are aligned according to application (personal, team, research enterprise) in such a way that the skills attained at the undergraduate level give students moving on to graduate work greater familiarity with data management and therefore greater likelihood of success at the graduate and then post graduate and data steward levels.\",\n",

      "      \"description\": \"In this chapter, issues relating to the digital literacy practices of girls aged from three to eight in both home and school contexts are explored. Since the late 1990s, there have been persistent concerns about boys' achieve- ment in literacy. Here, I argue that these concerns have overshadowed matters that should be considered by educationalists who are committed to gender equity in their classrooms. In this first section of the chapter, the nature of the anxieties expressed about boys and literacy are investigated before data from a number of projects that have focused on children's use of new technologies and related literacy practices are discussed. Three key issues are the focus for reflection. First, I suggest that girls' experiences of literacy across homes and early years settings are not as seamless as is often assumed and that girls as well as boys experience dissonance across these domains. Second, I suggest that there is a need to pay attention to the reductive gendered discourses that are embedded in many of the home literacy practices of girls in order to inform the development of critical literacy curricula. Finally, I consider the way in which initiatives designed to motivate boys through the incorporation of popular culture into the lit- eracy curriculum can reinforce gendered stereotypes and marginalize the out-of-school experiences of girls. This discussion is undertaken within a context in which it is acknowledged that there is a need to move beyond a simplistic binary which fuels the see-sawing debate regarding the achieve- ments of one gender at the expense of the other (Jackson 1998). I would suggest, as do many others, that such a position is an over-simplification of the issues and that we should address the needs of all pupils (Skelton and Francis 2003). However, in this chapter I have chosen to focus on an investigation into the experiences of young girls in the early years because this is where it is often erroneously assumed that literacy transitions from home to school are relatively seamless.\",\n",

      "      \"description\": \"In many literacy classrooms, students engage in public performances in which they use various texts, movements of their bodies, and verbal interactions. How do we interpret such events? In this article, we critique a representational mode of interpretation and describe an alternate mode. We argue that literacy performances are often about creating differences, including differences in the moving, shifting relations of semiotic resources and differences in the performed identities of participants. Such differences\\u2014effects and affective intensities\\u2014are lost or overly stabilized within conventional interpretations, which focus on asking how meanings are represented, organized, and produced in performances. Conventionally, the texts of performances (e.g., print, images, speech) are imagined to signify (or re-present) a world that lies behind them. The task of interpretation is approached as reading for meaning. In this mode, we conceive of performances as primarily communicational or informational. Alternatively, using rhizomatic analysis, we follow the emergence of relations and differences by mapping performance-in-motion. We discuss how rhizomatic analysis shifts attention away from fixed meanings and toward action and the new \\u201cbecomings\\u201d that are an important part of literacy performances. Data are drawn from an ethnographic study of interactions in a socially, culturally, and racially diverse high school American Studies classroom.\",\n",

      "      \"user\": \"blostben\",\n",
      "      \"description\": \"In an increasingly urbanized world, consequences for humans, animals, plants are often unknown. Fundamental changes in landscapes due to landscape fragmentation, intensified agriculture or biodiversity loss dramatically impact ecosystems and their functions. Humans increasingly shifted their lifestyle from outdoor activities towards indoors, which are facilitated and depend on mostly digital technologies that are discussed to increase the risk of nature alienation. On the other hand, these readily available digital technologies offer chances to connect with people worldwide. This connectivity offers manifold opportunities to share data and to recruit people looking for new entertaining and interesting experiences as cooperation partners for the scientific community in so-called citizen science approaches. In citizen science, non-scientists are integrated in the data gathering of scientists. Being part of scholarly research, the citizen scientists receive up-to-date information on the research topic, which fosters the learning of the scientific background and thereby ideally supports the general scientific literacy that might be little developed due to a lack of interaction with nature. Especially for children in an urban societal background, there are concerns of alienation from nature due a significant shift away from nature-based activity and recreation, when compared to past generations. However, even though direct contact with nature is nowadays often infrequent, a solid knowledge about nature is essential to understand the consequences of biodiversity loss, the limitation of natural resources and the need for a sustainable development. Theoretically, citizen science cooperation offers a unique opportunity to integrate the public in the scientific gain of knowledge, further explaining the nature of science and fostering an increased awareness for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. Inspired by these challenges, I investigated in my dissertation seed predation, an important ecosystem function that has hardly been part of citizen science project. As seed predation has only rarely been investigated along urban-rural gradients and to integrate the question if the background (urban vs. rural) of primary school children affects their environmental knowledge, I selected study sites in and around L\\u00fcneburg and Hamburg, in Northern Germany. In my ecological experiments, I found that slugs are important seed predators that independently of urbanization predated about 30% of all seeds in the anthropogenically used landscapes investigated. Also, I could for the first time integrate primary school children in a citizen science approach into this research and show that even seven year old children can record data as reliable as a scientist. Finally, I investigated the native species knowledge from the children taking part as citizen scientists in my research, considering possible differences due to their urban or rural background. Contrary to my expectation, the urban or rural background had no significant effect on the species knowledge. However, my work provides a good foundation to transfer the approach of introducing a basic foundation of a taxonomical species concept in primary school to foster further understanding on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. In summary, my dissertation combined different disciplinary approaches showing synergies between the single disciplines to support strategies for a successful sustainable development in the spirit of an education for sustainability. I could highlight the great potential of inter- and transdisciplinary approaches combining natural research with scientific literacy in a citizen science project on a local scale, which may serve as a model for implementing citizen science projects in schools elsewhere. I highly recommend this successful approach for similar cooperation on larger scales to counter challenges of pressing societal problems. Even though each cooperation will has its own unique challenges, the synergetic advantages will likely outweigh the disadvantages. In this context, there should be more emphasis on the education for sustainable development, not only in schools but other educational institutions like universities, to face the global urbanization with its manifold challenges and opportunities. Gerade in einer zunehmend urbanisierten Welt sind Menschen, aber auch Tiere und Pflanzen mit zahlreichen Ver\\u00e4nderungen konfrontiert, die in ihrer Konsequenz teils noch nicht bekannt oder auch nicht absehbar sind. Urbanisierung geht neben landschaftlichen Ver\\u00e4nderungen allgemein auch mit gesellschaftlichen Ver\\u00e4nderungen und technologischen Entwicklungen wie einer verst\\u00e4rkten Digitalisierung einher, was sich auf den Alltag aber auch auf die M\\u00f6glichkeiten des Informationsaustausches auswirkt. Zum einen findet eine Verlagerung der menschlichen Aktivit\\u00e4ten aus der Natur hin in geschlossene R\\u00e4ume mit einer Fokussierung und zugleich Abh\\u00e4ngigkeit von Technik statt, was die Frage einer m\\u00f6glichen Naturentfremdung aufwirft, zum anderen bietet dies M\\u00f6glichkeiten sich mit Menschen weltweit auf Knopfdruck zu vernetzen. Diese Vernetzung unter Einbezug neuer Techniken zum Datentransfer erm\\u00f6glicht es gro\\u00dfe Datenmengen teils \\u00fcber tausende Kilometer Entfernung auszutauschen, live an deren Generierung teilzunehmen oder diese zu bewerten. Diese M\\u00f6glichkeiten globaler Vernetzung werden heutzutage mehr und mehr daf\\u00fcr genutzt, Menschen die auf der Suche nach Unterhaltung sind, sei es als einmaliges Event oder kontinuierliche Besch\\u00e4ftigung, als Kooperationspartner f\\u00fcr die Wissenschaft zu rekrutieren. Gleichzeitig bietet sich dadurch die M\\u00f6glichkeit unsere Zivilbev\\u00f6lkerung in wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisprozesse verst\\u00e4rkt einzubinden, aber auch f\\u00fcr deren Arbeits- und Wirkungsweise zu sensibilisieren. Die vereinfachten Zug\\u00e4nge (naturwissenschaftliches) Wissen aus erster Hand zu erhalten sind hierbei nicht zu untersch\\u00e4tzen. Gerade in Zeiten von Biodiversit\\u00e4tsverlust, der Gef\\u00e4hrdung von \\u00d6kosystemen und gro\\u00dfen dr\\u00e4ngenden gesellschaftlichen Fragen globaler Ungerechtigkeit ist eine Sensibilisierung und Wahrnehmung von nachhaltigen L\\u00f6sungsans\\u00e4tzen globaler Probleme wichtiger denn je. Auf dieser Ausgangslage habe ich mich in meiner Dissertation mit dem Erforschen bzw. Verstehen einer \\u00d6kosystemfunktion entlang eines anthropogenen gepr\\u00e4gten Landschaftsgradienten besch\\u00e4ftigt und hierbei die wissenschaftliche Bildung von Grundschulkindern ber\\u00fccksichtigt, indem ich sie in einem sogenannten Citizen Science Projekt in mein naturwissenschaftliches Forschungsvorhaben einbezogen habe. Bei Citizen Science handelt es sich um eine bewusste Kooperation zwischen Menschen, die in der Wissenschaft arbeiten und solchen, die nicht zwangsl\\u00e4ufig einen wissenschaftlichen Hintergrund haben, sich aber f\\u00fcr diese und deren thematische Zug\\u00e4nge interessieren. Als Versuchsfl\\u00e4chen dienten mir Schulh\\u00f6fe in und um L\\u00fcneburg und Hamburg herum. In meiner Dissertation wollte ich gezielt die unterschiedlichen Denk-, Arbeits- und Handlungsweisen verschiedener Disziplinen aber auch Akteure nutzen, um Synergien im Sinne nachhaltiger Entwicklung und damit auch im Sinne einer Bildung f\\u00fcr nachhaltige Entwicklung zu leisten. Konkret habe ich hierbei die \\u00d6kosystemfunktion des Samenfra\\u00dfes entlang eines Stadt-Land-Gradientens untersucht und die Bedeutung von Schnecken f\\u00fcr den selbigen quantifiziert. Diese Forschung habe ich in einem Citizen Science Ansatz erstmals Grundschulkindern zug\\u00e4nglich gemacht, indem ich diese in die wissenschaftliche Datenerfassung einbezogen habe. Dieser Citizen Science Ansatz war gleichzeitig eine Pilotstudie um zu pr\\u00fcfen, ob Kinder im Alter von sieben bis zehn Jahren wissenschaftliche Daten so zuverl\\u00e4ssig erheben k\\u00f6nnen, dass sie mit denen von Wissenschaftlern vergleichbar sind. Dies hat sich als grunds\\u00e4tzlich m\\u00f6glich erwiesen, wobei der Erfolg der Erfassung grunds\\u00e4tzlich durch die Aufgabenkomplexit\\u00e4t bestimmt war. Dar\\u00fcber hinaus habe ich sichergestellt, dass die Kinder nicht einfach nur Teil eines wissenschaftlichen Projektes waren, sondern dass ihnen ein tieferes Verstehen sowohl \\u00fcber den fachwissenschaftlichen Hintergrund zum taxonomischen Artbegriff und \\u00d6kosystemfunktionen, als auch \\u00fcber die Natur der Naturwissenschaften (Nature of science) zug\\u00e4nglich war. In diesem Zusammenhang habe ich untersucht, ob es zwischen Kindern die in st\\u00e4dtischen und l\\u00e4ndlichen Gegenden aufwachsen Unterschiede in ihrem Wissen zu einheimischen Arten gibt, um m\\u00f6gliche Anzeichen von st\\u00e4dtisch bedingter Naturentfremdung aufzudecken. Zusammenfassend l\\u00e4sst sich sagen, dass ein inter- und transdisziplin\\u00e4rer Forschungsansatz einige Herausforderungen mit sich bringt, vor allem weil oftmals eine gemeinsame Sprache gefunden werden muss, allerdings \\u00fcberwiegen die synergetischen Vorteile diese Herausforderungen bei weitem, so dass dieser Ansatz als einzig plausibel erscheint, wenn es um die erfolgreiche Umsetzung von Zielen einer nachhaltigen Entwicklung gehen soll. Dieser Ansatz zeigt sich besonders im Gedanken einer Bildung f\\u00fcr nachhaltige Entwicklung, die die Bedeutung von Bildung im Zusammenhang mit wissenschaftlichen Zug\\u00e4ngen zur L\\u00f6sung globaler Probleme hervorhebt und im (schulischen) Alltag viel st\\u00e4rker forciert werden sollte.\",\n",

Data literacy is vital for researchers who need to become data literate science workers and also for (potential) data management professionals. Its important characteristic is a close connection and similarity to information literacy. To support this argument, a review of literature was undertaken on the importance of data, and the data-intensive paradigm of scientific research, researchers\\u2019 expected and real behaviour, the nature of research data management, the possible roles of the academic library, data quality and data citation, Besides describing the nature of data literacy and enumerating the related skills, the application of phenomenographic approaches to data literacy and its relationship to the digital humanities have been identified as subjects for further investigation.\",\n",

In outlining their approaches, successes, and failures in teaching with open data, it is argued that collaboration with data publishers is critical to improving data reuse and education.

This article reports the results of a multi-phase study conducted in informal learning environments in three US science museums. The goal of the study was to determine the familiarity of youth and adult museum visitors with different visualization types. To address this, a total of 273 visitors were shown 5 out of 20 different visualizations that included two charts, five maps, eight graphs, and five network layouts. They were asked to judge the familiarity of the visualization, provide information on how to read it, and provide a name and identify typical locations where they would encounter the data display and possible data sources that might be visualized in this way. The results show that while most participants have a strong interest in science, math, and art, many have a hard time naming and interpreting visualizations. Participants in this study commonly encounter visualizations in school, in books, at work, on the Internet, and in the news. Overall, they were more familiar with basic charts, maps, and graphs, but very few are familiar with network layouts and most have no ability in reading network visualizations. When asked how they would interpret the visualizations, most participants pointed to superficial features such as color, lines, or text as important to developing understanding. Overall, we found that participants were interested in the visualizations we presented to them, but had significant limitations in identifying and understanding them. The results substantiate intuitions shared by many regarding the rather low level of data visualization literacy of general audiences. We hope they will help catalyze novel research on the development of easy-to-use yet effective visualizations with standardized names and guaranteed properties that can be readily used by those interested to understand and solve real-world problems. The results also have implications for how information visualizations are taught and used in formal and informal education, the media, or in different professions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"R programming with map data interaction is another research area for data scientists due to high data publication in modern electronic records web applications at the federal administrative structure of Nepal. However the analysis of map and its presentation on web with interactively with data interperation has not much concern with data scientist while website design around the world. The data like central, province, local administrative government bodies many times published data for civil concerned. The dynamic records presentation with local boundaries map having interactive facilities has a new concept using r programming. Here the researcher could easily have developed the local administrative map using GIS shapefile then local level records generally gathered and stored in ms excel will automatically be integrated with this template easily so that local administrative agencies will easily update web site using r programming i.e rpubs. Which discards the registration domain, and knowledge of web application design intelligent site. The best application of this type of data interactive map with data interoperation would be highly applicable to local governance of Nepal where there was a large type of data and records that were developed in sequential order for public concern. The interactive VDC, district, province data commonly highlights data like, education rates and HDI information of any location that could easily be published. The developed model is available (http://rpubs.com/yagyarimal/556607) with interactive website pages quickly utilizing the intelligent markdown with a flash dashboard design template structure.

Data were collected by an email survey and sent to 792 academic researchers and doctoral students. Total response rate was 18\\\\% (N = 139). The measurement instrument consisted of six sets of questions: about data management plans, the assignment of additional information to research data, about metadata, standard file naming systems, training at data management methods and the storing of research data.Findings The main finding is that knowledge about the procedures of data management is limited, and data management is not a normal practice in the researcher's work. They were, however, in general, of the opinion that the university should take the lead by recommending and offering access to the necessary tools of data management. Taken together, the results indicate that there is an urgent need to increase the researcher's understanding of the importance of data management that is based on professional knowledge and to provide them with resources and training that enables them to make effective and productive use of data management methods.Research limitations/implications The survey was sent to all members of the population but not a sample of it. Because of the response rate, the results cannot be generalized to all researchers at the university. Nevertheless, the findings may provide an important understanding about their research data procedures, in particular what characterizes their knowledge about data management and attitude towards it.Practical implications Awareness of these issues is essential for information specialists at academic libraries, together with other units within the universities, to be able to design infrastructures and develop services that suit the needs of the research community. The findings can be used, to develop data policies and services, based on professional knowledge of best practices and recognized standards that assist the research community at data management.Originality/value The study contributes to the existing literature about research data management by examining the results by participants' field of research. Recognition of the issues is critical in order for information specialists in collaboration with universities to design relevant infrastructures and services for academics and doctoral students that can promote their research data management.\",\n",

In this two-year study we develop and test a strategy for using the scientific literature to teach science literacy skills to novice life science majors. The first year of the project served as a preliminary investigation in which we evaluated student science literacy skills, created a set of science literacy learning objectives aligned with Bloom's taxonomy, and developed a set of homework assignments that used peer-reviewed articles to teach science literacy. In the second year of the project the effectiveness of the assignments and the learning objectives were evaluated. Summative student learning was evaluated in the second year on a final exam. The mean score was 83.5% (\\ufffd20.3%) and there were significant learning gains (p < 0.05) in seven of nine of science literacy skills. Project data indicated that even though students achieved course-targeted lower-order science literacy objectives, many were deficient in higher-order literacy skills. Results of this project suggest that building scientific literacy is a continuing process which begins in first-year science courses with a set of fundamental skills that can serve the progressive development of literacy skills throughout the undergraduate curriculum.\",\n",

The data illustrate that there was a dissonance between out-of-school and schooled literacy practices and that there was more evidence nursery literacy practices infiltrating the home than vice versa. Children's literacy practices in the home were focused on media and popular cultural texts and the article argues for greater recognition of these cultural practices in early years policy documentation and curriculum guidance.

      "      \"abstract\": \"OBJECTIVE: To review the relationship between literacy and health outcomes. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), Public Affairs Information Service (PAIS), Industrial and Labor Relations Review (ILLR), PsychInfo, and Ageline from 1980 to 2003. STUDY SELECTION: We included observational studies that reported original data, measured literacy with any valid instrument, and measured one or more health outcomes. Two abstractors reviewed each study for inclusion and resolved disagreements by discussion. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted data from each article into an evidence table; the second reviewer checked each entry. The whole study team reconciled disagreements about information in evidence tables. Both data extractors independently completed an 11-item quality scale for each article; scores were averaged to give a final measure of article quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: We reviewed 3,015 titles and abstracts and pulled 684 articles for full review; 73 articles met inclusion criteria and, of those, 44 addressed the questions of this report. Patients with low literacy had poorer health outcomes, including knowledge, intermediate disease markers, measures of morbidity, general health status, and use of health resources. Patients with low literacy were generally 1.5 to 3 times more likely to experience a given poor outcome. The average quality of the articles was fair to good. Most studies were cross-sectional in design; many failed to address adequately confounding and the use of multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Low literacy is associated with several adverse health outcomes. Future research, using more rigorous methods, will better define these relationships and guide developers of new interventions.\",\n",

At the end of the training period the teacher trainees were relatively fluent and versatile information seekers who were able to cope with the challenges of lesson planning and support textbooks with information retrieved from various information sources.\\r\\nConclusions. The results indicate that the trainees had the necessary skills to seek and use information for lesson plans.

Sampling method was categorized random sampling. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings showed that the mean level of Media and Information Literacy among Grade 12 students of Andres Bonifacio College students was 3.01 interpreted as Good, and is higher than average . The highest mean was learning new subjects with 3.25 and the lowest mean was the use of Boolean operations in the research with 2.54. There was a significant mean difference in the levels of media and information literacy when participants were grouped according to career strand. The results showed that the students especially from the Technical Vocational Livelihood track \\u2013 Information and Communication Technology did not have enough skills in starting the research, finding references and other media and other information resources, defining the research subject as well as the use of Boolean operations in the search. Generally, students, librarians and education practitioners should pay special attention to factors affecting in improving Media and Information Literacy level of students as a main capability in using printed and electronic resources for research and for other academic purpose.

      "      \"abstract\": \"This paper describes empirical research examining secondary school teachers' conceptions of student information literacy and reflects on the implications for the development of information-literate students. The research was designed to be practitioner centred, focusing on curriculum-based information activities and the student learning process from the teacher perspective. The study took a   broadly phenomenographic approach and data were collected through a series of group discussions and interviews with subject teachers. Teachers described   student information literacy in terms of a variety of skills and processes which overlap with existing models and frameworks. However, significant differences  from other models and definitions included the absence of defining the information need and knowledge building. Teachers' conceptions evolved during  the study and were influenced by individual experiences and curriculum priorities. The study suggests that overemphasis on mechanistic skills   development without local debate and understanding hinders the alignment of information literacy with independent and lifelong learning. A number of   challenges are identified for the development of information literacy in UK secondary schools, not least the fact that information literacy was understood  by teachers in isolation from the subject curriculum. The study also sheds light on possible reasons why students may not leave school as information-literate  individuals. 10.1177/0961000607083211\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (Framework) grows out of a belief that information literacy as an educational reform movement will realize its potential only through a richer, more complex set of core ideas. During the fifteen years since the publication of the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education,1 academic librarians and their partners in higher education associations have developed learning outcomes, tools, and resources that some institutions have deployed to infuse information literacy concepts and skills into their curricula. However, the rapidly changing higher education environment, along with the dynamic and often uncertain information ecosystem in which all of us work and live, require new attention to be focused on foundational ideas about that ecosystem. Students have a greater role and responsibility in creating new knowledge, in understanding the contours and the changing dynamics of the world of information, and in using information, data, and scholarship ethically. Teaching faculty have a greater responsibility in designing curricula and assignments that foster enhanced engagement with the core ideas about information and scholarship within their disciplines. Librarians have a greater responsibility in identifying core ideas within their own knowledge domain that can extend learning for students, in creating a new cohesive curriculum for information literacy, and in collaborating more extensively with faculty.\",\n",

We think of knowing and learning science as situated in and distributed across social and material aspects of a setting. To support the proposed conception, we provide several detailed cases from our three-year multi-site ethnographic study of science in one community, featuring different types of citizens who walk a creek, interact during an environment-oriented open-house event, discuss water problems, collect data, and have different conceptions of human-environment relations. The case studies show that collectively, much more advanced forms of scientific literacy are produced than any individual (including scientists) could produce. Creating opportunities for scientific literacy to emerge from collective activity, irrespective of whether one or more participants know some basic scientific facts, presents challenges to science educators very different from teaching basic facts and skills to individuals.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"INTRODUCTION Data management education has been part of library service models for almost 2 decades. This paper describes a pilot graduate student education program whose framework shows interdependencies between data management practices, uses a flipped classroom model to allow maximum time for implementation, and whose primary activities are entirely student research based. lLITERATURE REVIEW Education in data management encompasses many different formats (in-person, online, synchronous, asynchronous). Within this instruction, Data Information Literacy competencies help define student-learning objectives for data management tasks. Currently data management education is a combination of theory and active learning, with students asking for more hands-on practice. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION This program is an 8-week, in-person, flipped classroom series that addresses all data life cycle stages and aligns with many Data Information Literacy competencies. It is entirely student research data focused in that activities require that they use their projects, with significant time allocated to implement these practices while in the classroom. NEXT STEPS With a 69% retention rate and student improvement in seven foundational data management concepts, this program is considered a success. Future work involves converting this program to a credit-bearing course.\",\n",

The purpose of the study is to propose a framework for citizen's digital literacy to fill the gap of the current model of digital opportunity which emphasizes physical ac- cessibility without specific action plan for intellectual accessibility. By analyzing the daily activities of Internet use and identifying the groups of these activities, we propose a conceptual framework of citizen's digi- tal literacy. Secondary data from a national-wide survey, the fifth phase of the fourth year survey of the TSCS Research Project (Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS), 2009) is used. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared, logistic regression and multidimensional scaling analyses are conducted to reveal the citizen's use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) over time and of which the relationship with the citizen's demo- graphic data. The results suggest an overview of primary online informa- tion activities engaged by citizens, including (1) gaining information of traveling, information technology, news and knowledge acquisition, (2) consuming and finance, and (3) social networking and communication. Although information activities for learning and work purposed in the survey have not been significant which may be due to the design of the survey questions, findings from multidimensional scaling suggest that there seems to be a hierarchy of information needs, similar to Maslow's (1943) basic needs, manifested in Internet use activities. Different from the traditional approach of information literacy focusing on information seeking sills, digital literacy goes beyond to the territory of doing, actual conducting of daily activities by using ICTs. A conceptual framework as well as a working model for citizen's digital literacy is suggested for future research.\",\n",

Although there are many research attempts investigating digital literacy in science teacher education literature, the interrelations of this concept to cognitive and metacognitive aspects are still blurred. In this regard, this study was conducted to investigate the structural relations among preservice science teachers\\u2019 epistemological beliefs, self-regulated learning skills, and digital literacy as well as the reasons for these relations. A sequential explanatory research design guided this two-step study. The first step involved structural equation modeling analysis of data from 612 preservice science teachers. The second step focused on the reasons for the structural relations observed in the first step. Six participants were selected as the cases in the latter. Overall, the results showed that participants\\u2019 epistemological beliefs, self-regulation skills, and digital literacy are closely related to each other. Epistemological and self-regulational filters as well as epistemic bias and the context in which the filters exist directly affect these relationships. Considering the results, it was suggested that preservice science teachers should be involved in inquiry-based and argumentation-based learning mediums since these types of mediums contribute positively to the development of epistemological beliefs and self-regulation skills.\",\n",

The factors of open science are identified, including relations with broader public and transparent information policies, practices, methods, data and publications. Models of digital scholarship are considered. The second part of the paper reports on results of a qualitative study of information behavior of 19 researchers in Slovakia. Semi-structured interviews and conceptual modeling were applied. Findings point to common methodological analytical procedures and differences in problem statements, data management and publishing strategies. Less awareness of open access, digital sources and publicity of research results was noted. Disciplinary differences are manifested mainly in publishing, procedures and evaluation of results. In conclusion, a resulting ecological framework of research information interactions and research information literacy based on understanding and sense making are proposed. Implications for researchers' information spaces as part of knowledge infrastructure are considered.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This article explores the use of digital and multimodal compositions among preservice elementary education students in a university language and literacy methods course. Furthermore, this piece argues for the inclusion of multimodal representation in our literacy courses given the changes in our digital landscape and the ever-increasing multimodality of our representational and communicational means online. This research aligns with a burgeoning collection of literature, namely New Literacies (Knobel & Lankshear, 2007) and multimodality (Kress & van Leeuwen, 2001).  In addition, this research merges with \\u2018traditional\\u2019 print-based literacy pedagogies that argue for models of teacher learning that foreground opportunities to \\u2018do\\u2019 digital composition in order to more effectively prepare students for 21st century literacy skills in epistemologically diverse digital environments. A combination of discourse and multimodal analysis provides a means to couple both linguistic and semiotic data to examine how multimodal design functions in the construction of teacher identities and how the flexibility of these identities in turn work to prepare new teachers for successful transitions into public school cultures. In other words, how might the practice of multimedia production, and reflection on those processes, foster a deeper self-awareness during a time when students are moving from university settings into public schools? This article argues that multimodal text design is dialogic and purposeful with regards to constructions of teacher identities and highlights two \\u2018Digital Literacy Projects,\\u2019 multimodal video compositions designed and produced by preservice teachers with video editing software. The two DLPs contrast the potential for authors to stabilize and/or improvise formations of identity, both which create opportunities to engage in praxis that merge university experiences with public school responsibilities.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The concept of digital literacy has been introduced as a new cultural technique, which is regarded as essential for successful participation in a (future) digitized world. Regarding the increasing importance of AI, literacy concepts need to be extended to account for AI-related specifics. The easy handling of the systems results in increased usage, contrasting limited conceptualizations (e.g., imagination of future importance) and competencies (e.g., knowledge about functional principles). In reference to voice-based conversational agents as a concrete application of AI, the present paper aims for the development of a measurement to assess the conceptualizations and competencies about conversational agents. In a first step, a theoretical framework of \\u201cAI literacy\\u201d is transferred to the context of conversational agent literacy. Second, the \\u201cconversational agent literacy scale\\u201d (short CALS) is developed, constituting the first attempt to measure interindividual differences in the \\u201c(il) literate\\u201d usage of conversational agents. 29 items were derived, of which 170 participants answered. An explanatory factor analysis identified five factors leading to five subscales to assess CAL: storage and transfer of the smart speaker\\u2019s data input; smart speaker\\u2019s functional principles; smart speaker\\u2019s intelligent functions, learning abilities; smart speaker\\u2019s reach and potential; smart speaker\\u2019s technological (surrounding) infrastructure. Preliminary insights into construct validity and reliability of CALS showed satisfying results. Third, using the newly developed instrument, a student sample\\u2019s CAL was assessed, revealing intermediated values. Remarkably, owning a smart speaker did not lead to higher CAL scores, confirming our basic assumption that usage of systems does not guarantee enlightened conceptualizations and competencies. In sum, the paper contributes to the first insights into the operationalization and understanding of CAL as a specific subdomain of AI-related competencies.\",\n",

This paper examines the question of how members of a literate society progress from a natural beginning towards a mastery of increasingly formalized definition-making. We suggest that formal definition-making is one aspect of becoming literate, where literacy is defined as using and creating written texts. Focusing on the use of the expression of the relationship between parts and wholes, we present data from three sources, including children, university students, and an English-language dictionary. Our findings suggest that one important aspect of acquiring literacy is learning to make formal definitions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The use of the Internet for learning provides a unique and growing opportunity to revisit the task of quantifying how much people have learned about a given subject in different regions around the world. Google alone receives over 5 billion searches a day and its publicly available data provides insight into learning process that is otherwise unobservable on a global scale. In this paper we, introduce the Computer Science Literacy-Proxy Index via Search (CSLI-s), a measure that utilizes online search data to make an educated guess around trends in computer science education. This measure uses a statistical signal processing technique to compose search volumes from a spectrum of topics into a coherent score. We intentionally explore and mitigate the biases of search data and, in the process, develop CSLI-s scores that correlate with traditional, more expensive metrics of learning. We then use search-trend data to measure patterns in subject literacy across countries and over time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first measure of learning via Internet search-trends. The Internet is becoming a standard tool for learners and, as such, we anticipate search-trend data will have growing relevance to the learning science community.\",\n",

By opening up data beyond the now familiar hand crafted Web 2 mash up of data about X plus geography, what are we trying to do, really? Is the goal at least in part to enable net citizens rather than only geeks the ability to pick up, explore, blend, interogate and represent data sources so that we may draw our own statistically informed conclusions about information, and thereby build new knowledge in ways not readily possible before without access to these data seas? If we want citizens rather than just scientists or statisticians or journalists for that matter to be able to pour over data and ask statistically sophisticated questions of comparison and contrast betewen times, places and people, does that mission re-order our research priorities at all? If the goal is to enpower citizens to be able to make use of data, what do we need to make this vision real beyond attending to Tim Berners-Lee's call to free your data? The purpose of this talk therefore will be to look at key ineraction issues around defining and delivering a useful, usable data explorotron for citizens. In particular, we'll consider who is a citizen user and what access to and tools for linked data sense making means in this case. From that perspective, we'll consider research issues around discovery, exploration, interrogation and representation of data for not only a single wild data source but especially for multiple wild heterogeneous data sources. I hope this talk may help frame some stepping stones towards useful and usable interaction with linked data, and look forward to input from the community to refine such a new literacy agenda further.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The modern period witnessed the increased gender disparity reflected in sex-ratio, literacy and education, employment and wage-rates and several other socio-cultural and behavioral indicators of empowerment.(Nangia, 2005) Gender equality is more than a goal in itself. It is a precondition for meeting the challenges of reducing poverty, promoting sustainable development and building good governance -Kofi Annan (Personal, Archive, Mahanta, & Nayak, 2013). The present paper examines the extent of gender disparity in Belagavi District based on literacy and sex ratio using secondary data. We found that literacy rate in study area was 76.93 % in 2001 which is increased to 82.90 % in 2011 and sex ratio in the study area was 960 in 2001 which is increased to 973 in 2011. There are wide disparities from Rural to Urban sex ratio as well as Rural to Urban literacy rate. The urban sex ratio is higher than rural sex ratio in study area. The Rural sex ratio is 970 and urban sex ratio is 979 females per thousand males in the 2011. We found that in Belagavi district, there is reduction in gender disparities from 2001 to 2011 but the reduction rate is very slow.

As a result, fostering online privacy literacy is often discussed as a potential solution to data protection issues on the Internet. So far, online privacy has been operationalised as a knowledge concept. Research has shown that privacy knowledge is related to more self-data-protection. However, it is not clear whether a respective promotion actually contributes to a more self-determined behaviour on the Internet, and we also do not know whether it makes people behave more deliberate and more in accordance with their privacy needs. This paper argues that online privacy literacy has to be conceptualised as a combination of knowledge and specific abilities and skills. We propose a reconceptualisation that includes privacy-related reflection and critical abilities, as well as practical privacy and data protection skills. We also include factorial knowledge about economic, technical, and legal aspects of online privacy.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Abstract This study of information literacy focuses on opinions, evidence, reviews, and data analysis from a sample of Spanish university students from three major fields of study (information/documentation, psychology, and translation/interpretation). The results have been tabulated from the subject area of documentation alone, as this subject is shared in the students' curricular planning. This study highlights students' attitudes, motivation, and evidence with regard to information literacy (IL) competencies. The standardized statistical model for evaluating latent traits was used to capture the structure of such capabilities. Data collection was performed using the IL-HUMASS (subjective) and the EVALCI-K (objective) questionnaires. The purpose is to achieve a better understanding of how \\\\IL\\\\ competencies\\u2014approached from both objective and subjective perspectives, and grouped into the categories of searching, evaluation, processing, and communication/dissemination of information\\u2014are interrelated. In this way, by combining objective (knowledge and skills) and subjective (belief-inimportance and self-efficacy) values with regard to \\\\IL\\\\ competencies, the processes of teaching and learning may be better understood and therefore better integrated within the curriculum framework. Patterns of correlation and/or causality between observed and latent competencies are explored.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Making connections can facilitate learning in several ways, for example, linking new ideas to existing schema or cueing the use of available skills for use in different contexts. The paper focuses on links between reading and writing. Theory suggests common processes operate in reading and writing that are mutually supportive in learning; empirically the relationship between performance in reading and writing is significant. There is evidence that specific writing practices can improve reading and, similarly, that reading can impact writing. This paper presents and applies empirically a framework for analysing the nature of the links that teachers make in literacy learning settings. The framework encompasses both the sites for, and the types of, connection; it is applied using observations and the associated transcripts from two corpora of literacy lessons from guided reading and teacher-led segments of writing lessons at the primary school level. The framework and these data provide a tentative indication of typical practice and important information for professional learning.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The paper analyses individual human capital, measured by the education, literacy and numeracy skills, and explores to what extent immigrants employ their cognitive skills at work. Based on the Program of International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data for 15 European countries, we document that, on average, foreign-born respondents achieve substantially worse scores in literacy and numeracy test domains in majority of analysed countries. Only immigrants in the Nordic countries reveal skill improvement over immigration tenure. Once we account for both skill levels and use of skills at work in wage regressions, no statistically significant gap in earnings across immigrants and natives remains. Although, once immigrants attain comparable to natives\\u2019 skill use frequency, their pay disadvantage turns statistically insignificant in all countries, except Estonia and Ireland. The results are leading us to the conclusion that potential for development and utilization of immigrants\\u2019 skills in the European labour markets is still underused. Immigrants are not yet sufficiently well integrated in labour markets in most of the European countries.\",\n",

Many individuals rely on their social networks to gather information thanks to social media?s ability to share information rapidly and over a much greater geographic range. However, this creates an overall false balance as people tend to seek out information that is compatible with their existing views and values. They deliberately seek out ?facts? and data that specifically support their conclusions and classify any information that contradicts their beliefs as ?false news.? Navigating Fake News, Alternative Facts, and Misinformation in a Post-Truth World is a collection of innovative research on human and automated methods to deter the spread of misinformation online, such as legal or policy changes, information literacy workshops, and algorithms that can detect fake news dissemination patterns in social media. While highlighting topics including source credibility, share culture, and media literacy, this book is ideally designed for social media managers, technology and software developers, IT specialists, educators, columnists, writers, editors, journalists, broadcasters, newscasters, researchers, policymakers, and students.\",\n",

Written in the teen mystery genre, Kontax was targeted at teens aged between fourteen and seventeen years and was intitially published in daily episodes in both English and isiXhosa on the mobisite www.kontax.mobi (a \\r\\nwebsite designed specifically for use on mobile phones). It was later also released on local mobile social network and instant messaging platform, MXit.\\r\\nThe m4Lit research project investigated how South African teens responded to Kontax, and how compatible the m-novel was with teens' existing mobile literacy practices. The m4lLit research project focused on exploring an apparent paradox of literacy in South Africa. In most of the country's under-performing schools, a majority of teens are left behind academically, many experience difficulties with literacy instruction and most have limited access to books and  computers. Yet, as a result of South Africa's mobile phone \\\"revolution\\\" and a thriving mobile youth culture, outside school teens increasingly enjoy frequent rich interactions with the written word and with digital technologies in their peer networks. The m4Lit project asked whether South African teens' enthusiasm about text on phones and their widespread access to mobile Internet could be used in a  \\r\\nliteracy development project which attempted to bridge the gap between in-school and out-ofschool literacies, via leisure reading and writing of fiction.\\r\\nA group of isiXhosa-speaking teens (ages 14-17) from Langa and Guguletu were recruited as m4Lit participants. Mobile internet access is pervasive in many South African urban areas, even for  economically and educationally marginalized teens (Kreutzer, 2009), such as those who participated in this study. All participants were required to have some form of mobile internet access \\r\\n(either via their own phone or via shared phones). The research project investigated whether these teens accessed the m-novel via their phones and whether reading a mobile novel online fitted in with their existing mobile literacy practices.  Two surveys (n=61 and n=50), two focus groups (n=10), \\r\\nand usability evalutions (n=8) were conducted. Data from the MXit campaign and from the Kontax mobisite were also analysed to gain insights into the responses of a broader audience.\",\n",

It is about using technology to create new values or change the business model. Digitally transformed businesses typically create an ecosystem where all market participants and consumers participate. 1st July, 2015 is a day when an initiative was being taken by our honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi towards \\\"making India Digital\\\". The campaign aimed to connect rural areas with high speed internet network and to improve the digital literacy. Indian economy is growing at a fast pace that requires the people to be financial literate to take judicious decisions. After this digitalization, the financial transactions have to be done through internet. So, Digital financial literacy is gaining importance. This paper analyses the importance of financial literacy in today's world. The finding of the study will identify the obstacles in the execution of various programmes to make India financial literate and strategies to execute these policies effectively and efficiently. There are some financial services providers that have taken on a back seat approach and observe the developments in this digitalization space. This is probably a safer approach given the risks and costs involved. On the other extreme end, there are also financial service providers who have yet to embark on any digitalization strategy. However, this does not mean they will not be able to leapfrog ahead once they have strategized their digital strategy. Dr. Amardeep D.

Research has shown that higher patient health literacy is linked to more successful health outcomes and the shift to electronic medical records (EMR) is hoped to increase efficency. Although EMR systems are designed to support physicians' clinical decision making, they can also hamper physician-patient communication, especially in the challenging conditions associated with interpreter-mediated interaction with low English proficiency patients. This paper examines EMR interaction and interpreter-mediated physician-patient communication. Based on a distributed cognition perspective that employs a novel methodology to simultaneously capture multiple data streams, we analyze multiparty and multimodal activity. The goal is to inform design of new multimodal healthcare interfaces.\",\n",

At the heart of this vision is the citizen, who is the primary beneficiary of smart city initiatives, either directly or indirectly. Despite the recent surge of research and smart cities initiatives in practice, there are still a number of challenges to overcome in realizing this vision. This position paper points out six citizen-related challenges: the engagement of citizens, the improvement of citizens\\u2019 data literacy, the pairing of quantitative and qualitative data, the need for open standards, the development of personal services, and the development of persuasive interfaces. The article furthermore advocates the use of methods and techniques from GIScience to tackle these challenges, and presents the concept of an Open City Toolkit as a way of transferring insights and solutions from GIScience to smart cities.\",\n",

The Sustainable Library's Cookbook collects a series of engaging activities for academic libraries interested in implementing sustainability practices in three different areas: *Applying Sustainability Thinking and Development. Recipes are focused on applying sustainable thinking processes to library functions and services, including open educational resources, seed libraries, and reusable supplies and resources. *Teaching, Learning, and Research Services. This section contains lesson plans, learning guides, research activities, and projects that focus on sustainability in disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches, from STEM data literacy to campus sustainability projects to Indigenous environmental justice. *Community Engagement, Outreach, and Partnerships. Recipes emphasize how community partnerships and outreach can be effective ways to inform and foster sustainability practices in the library and beyond, including environmental movie nights, bike-lending programs, and ideas for sustainable fashion. Many of these recipes include learning outcomes and goals from ACRL's Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education, disciplinary focuses, and the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. This cookbook provides librarians with a series of best and effective practices, case studies, and approaches to support sustainability efforts in the library and collaboratively across campus.\\\" --\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cookbook provides librarians with a series of best and effective practices, case studies, and approaches to support sustainability efforts in the library and collaboratively across campus.\",\n",

Issues and challenges facing educators linked to learning analytics and current research gaps were organised into four themes, the further development of which by the expert panel, led to six strategy and action areas. The four themes are 1. development of data literacy in all stakeholders, 2. updating of guiding principles and policies of educational data, 3. standards needed for ethical practices with data quality assurance, and 4. flexible user-centred design for a variety of users of analytics, starting with learners and ensuring that learners and learning is not harmed. The strategies and actions are outcomes of the expert panel discussion and are offered as provocations to organise and focus the researcher, policymaker and practitioner dialogs needed to make progress in the field.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"We identify gender-specific needs and barriers to weather-index insurance. We test farmers' preferences for non-traditional weather-index insurance-savings bundles. Our results indicate a gender gap in farmers' weather-index insurance product preferences. This gap appears to be caused by differences in institutional trust and financial literacy. Bundled weather-index insurance-savings disinterest women; most farmers favor standalone inundation insurance. Theoretically, weather-index insurance is an effective risk reduction option for small-scale farmers in low income countries. Renewed policy and donor emphasis on bridging gender gaps in development also emphasizes the potential social safety net benefits that weather-index insurance could bring to women farmers who are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change risk and have low adaptive capacity. To date, no quantitative studies have experimentally explored weather-index insurance preferences through a gender lens, and little information exists regarding gender-specific preferences for (and constraints to) smallholder investment in agricultural weather-index insurance. This study responds to this gap, and advances the understanding of preference heterogeneity for weather-index insurance by analysing data collected from 433 male and female farmers living on a climate change vulnerable coastal island in Bangladesh, where an increasing number of farmers are adopting maize as a potentially remunerative, but high-risk cash crop. We implemented a choice experiment designed to investigate farmers' valuations for, and trade-offs among, the key attributes of a hypothetical maize crop weather-index insurance program that offered different options for bundling insurance with financial saving mechanisms. Our results reveal significant insurance aversion among female farmers, irrespective of the attributes of the insurance scheme. Heterogeneity in insurance choices could however not be explained by differences in men's and women's risk and time preferences, or agency in making agriculturally related decisions. Rather, gendered differences in farmers' level of trust in insurance institutions and financial literacy were the key factors driving the heterogeneous preferences observed between men and women. Efforts to fulfill gender equity mandates in climate-smart agricultural development programs that rely on weather-index insurance as a risk-abatement tool are therefore likely to require a strengthening of institutional credibility, while coupling such interventions with financial literacy programs for female farmers.\",\n",

More than 14 hours of in-class observations were used to track engagement, and 64 artifacts of student learning were collected and coded to evaluate learning comprehension. After coding, interrater reliability was established using the intraclass correlation coefficient to establish the validity of the ratings. This paper will outline these methodologies, present the results of the data analysis, and discuss the possibilities and difficulties of measuring student engagement in information literacy instruction centred upon active learning.\",\n",

However some universities especially in developing country contexts are struggling to attain minimal educational benefits from its adoption and use. This paper investigates the application of a peer assignment review process for collaborative e-learning to third year undergraduate students. The study was aimed at evaluating the effect of the peer assignment review process on the student learning process. Data was collected using a survey questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS Version 16.0. While the student reported positive impact of the peer assignment review process in terms of facilitating students to put more effort and improve their work; quick feedback on their assignments; effective sharing and development of knowledge and information and the need of computer competence to manipulate the peer assignment review system, analysis of the quantitative data indicated that the process had limited effect on the learning process. This is attributed to lack of review skills, absence of lecturer scaffolding, low ICT literacy levels and change management.\",\n",

Multilevel models for repeated measures analysis were used to compare models for predicting trends on nine different aspects of school technology integration. Results show statistically significant differences between high and low SES schools at every level in terms of student access to software, student use of software, teacher use of software, and the level of technology support.

      "      \"abstract\": \"In modern librarianship there is a lot more need for practical engagement than just fostering information literacy and dissemination. The 2030 United Nations agenda emphasizes action points for environmental sustainability, which involve reduction of pollution and waste, governing the environment, boosting the renewable energy, health ecosystems, combating climate change, improving soil and water sanitation, increasing resource efficiency, and safeguarding the oceans. These actions necessitate collective responsibility from all stakeholders including; LIS professionals, policy makers, politicians, development partners and practitioners. The aim of this paper was to establish the practical and probable measures through which LIS professionals can engage in the action of environmental restoration. The study was informed by published literature on the involvement by LIS and other professionals, locally and internationally in environmental sustainability actions. An online questionnaire, with structured and open ended questions, was used to collect data from 60 LIS professionals in Africa, of whom the majority (55%) were from Uganda, 56.7% male, and 81.7% primarily working as librarians. The study revealed that LIS professionals are aware of environmental degradation activities though only 55% are aware of the global environmental strategy of the 2030 UN Agenda. Deforestation and air pollution were reported as the most commonly known activities which destroy the environment. It was established that LIS professionals and their affiliate institutions and organizations are mostly involved in the greening campaign more than any other activity. The main challenge to environmental conservation, as reported from the study, is lack of sufficient resources to support the planned activities, however, it was suggested that LIS professionals engage more in the development, implementation, and promotion of awareness campaigns for waste reduction and environmental literacy. Finally it was recommended that LIS professionals develop a strong collaboration with other stakeholders and engage in all other possible activities to enhance environmental sustainability.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"It becomes truth that students cannot imagine living without computers. Computers were present during major part of their life and during their whole education. Many of today's students are better typists then hand writer and they acquire information from the internet almost immediately. In their life Google and Wikipedia are primary source of information. Despite their apparent computer literacy and knowledge we still need to teach them digital competences. Their waste knowledge is just superficial and limited to the first few hits on Google. Sadly their stamina in the research activities is low. These students are aware of digital security because they hear about it everywhere; they will become teachers; and they will teach kids and teenagers how to behave in the internet. We conduct a research to verify the level of comprehension of digital security among two generations of students (freshmen and third year). In our research we focus on data security; fraud recognition; and identity theft. Students show great knowledge in the area of fraud recognition less knowledge in identity theft and great ignorance about data security. Detailed results of the research is presented in the article.\",\n",

A test covering three main dimensions of digital literacy (theoretical, operational and evaluation skills) was administered to a random sample of 65 third-year high school classes, producing data on 980 students. Items include knowledge questions, situation-based questions and tasks to be performed online. A Rasch-type model was used to score the results. In agreement with the literature, the sample performed better in operational skills, while showing a particularly poor performance regarding evaluation skills (although for this dimension the test shows reliability issues). Through a robust regression analysis we investigate if a skills divide based on ascriptive differences, gender and family cultural background, exists among the students. It emerges that cultural background has a significant effect, which is stronger on operational skills, while gender shows a more definite impact on theoretical knowledge.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Recent research demonstrates that videogames enhance literacy, attention, reaction time, and higher-level \\r\\nthinking. Several scholars have suggested that massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) such as \\r\\nEverquest and  Second Life have educational potential, but we have little data about what happens when \\r\\nsuch tools are introduced in the classroom. This paper reports findings from two MMO-based courses in the \\r\\ncontext of situated learning theory. The first course, focused on the ethnography of on-line games, used the \\r\\ngame  Everquest as a vehicle for teaching  research methods to 36 students in an undergraduate \\r\\ncommunication course. The second course used the game Second Life to teach the fundamentals of videogame design and criticism. Synthesizing comments from student web logs with data collected from followup surveys, the paper highlights key findings and offers concrete suggestions for instructors contemplating \\r\\nthe use of multiplayer games in their own courses. Recommending that potential virtual environments be \\r\\nselected on the basis of genre, accessibility, and extensibility, it is suggested that game-based assignments \\r\\nare most effective when they build bridges between the domain of the game world and an overlapping \\r\\ndomain of professional practice.\",\n",

On completion, the system will be evaluated across three pilot studies. The three pilots will involve more than 3000 students across ten European countries and they will assess the impact of usage of the ARETE system and the educational value of AR for English literacy skills, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) skills and in the implementation of Positive Behaviour Support in Schools (PBIS). ARETE will also be involved in the implementation of new standards for the creation of cross platform content and services as well as the creation of learning experience data repositories.\",\n",

The growth of R's usage in hydrology is reflected in the number of newly published hydrological packages, the strengthening of online user communities, and the popularity of training courses and events. In this paper, we explore the benefits and advantages of R's usage in hydrology, such as: the democratization of data science and numerical literacy, the enhancement of reproducible research and open science, the access to statistical tools, the ease of connecting R to and from other languages, and the support provided by a growing community. This paper provides an overview of important packages at every step of the hydrological workflow, from the retrieval of hydro-meteorological data, to spatial analysis and cartography, hydrological modelling, statistics, and the design of static and dynamic visualizations, presentations and documents. We discuss some of the challenges that arise when using R in hydrology and useful tools to overcome them, including the use of hydrological libraries, documentation and vignettes (long-form guides that illustrate how to use packages); the role of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs); and the challenges of Big Data and parallel computing in hydrology. Last, this paper provides a roadmap for R's future within hydrology, with R packages as a driver of progress in the hydrological sciences, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) providing new avenues for data acquisition and provision, enhanced teaching of hydrology in R, and the continued growth of the community via short courses and events.</p>\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The last three decades have seen the emergence of a diverse global environmental movement. Social scientists have done much to explain the social distribution of environmentally damaging human activities, in terms of class, race, and location in the global economy, but have had less success in explaining social responses to environmental problems. How and why do nations differ in their responses to environmental problems? How and why do individuals' attitudes toward the environment differ? This dissertation presents an account of individual and national variation based on two arguments. The first is that mass education is a crucial ingredient shaping global environmentalism, because broad systems of mass education (A) encourage citizenship interest in politics, (B) increase general literacy, (C) promote individualism, and (D) increasingly incorporates ecological and scientific topics in school curricula. The second argument is that global environmentalism is bifurcated into two \\\"types\\\" or \\u00f6rders of justification\\\": modern environmentalism, which embraces science; and postmodern environmentalisms, in which science is less central. In combination, these two arguments yield a series of hypotheses that are tested on public opinion data and data on the establishment of environmental organizations. Modern and postmodern environmentalisms turn out to have distinct social bases, and Western-style mass education plays a pivotal role in shaping each form of environmentalism.\",\n",

However, studies examining students\\u2019 genre-based learning in such a framework are still underrepresented in current ESP genre-based literature. This study focused on a Chinese-speaking graduate student in electrical engineering who analyzed genre exemplars in preparation for writing. My analysis of the data reveals this student's two prominent and interrelated ways of analyzing the discourse-level generic features in discipline-specific genre exemplars. They are (a) rhetorical, as evidenced in his consistent attention not only to the generic features, but also to the underlying rhetorical parameters, such as reader, writer, and purpose and (b) evaluative, as shown in his increasingly sophisticated evaluation of the discourse-level generic features in the genre exemplars. The student's rhetorical and evaluative reading of the genre exemplars highlights the potential power of genre as an explicit, supportive tool for building academic literacy.\",\n",

Libraries need to talk about the valuable work they are doing in their communities by making use of activities, data/ statistics, and stories, to relate to the SDGs and to align themselves with national development plans. Most South Africans still do not have adequate access to libraries or information services. Communities in rural parts of the country have been largely excluded from any meaningful development and suffer from a lack of infrastructure. Illiteracy, unemployment, health care, economic development and education remain major national challenges. Having access to libraries and information could make all the difference to the quality of lives and circumstances for all people. Libraries have a critical role to play in the lives of information deprived communities. Not only do libraries nurture and grow literacy, but also they are better positioned to serve community development and enhance social cohesion.\",\n",

Such activities also\\nhelps in laying the foundation for computer programming courses and scientific\\ninquiry at elementary level. We present a learning environment and a curriculum\\nusing Lego simple machines and mechanism kit. Our objective is not only to\\nteach concepts of basic machines but also develop essential skills like team\\nwork and collaboration, communication and time management in students belonging\\nto the early childhood age group. We conduct experiments on a batch of five\\nstudents during a summer camp and used a mixed method approach to collect both\\nqualitative and quantitative data about their learning and behavior.

This paper draws on three years (spring 2012\\u2013spring 2014) of data from an online course on Internet literacy and ethics for practicing teachers. Two sets of samples (128 and 248 teachers) facilitated this study's exploration and confirmation of the TROLM model's constructs. Results of exploratory and confirmatory factory analysis support an 18-item scale comprising four factors: communication self-efficacy, institutional support, self-directed learning, and learning-transfer self-efficacy. This study found that male teachers exhibited statistically significantly greater readiness in the dimension of learning-transfer self-efficacy than did female teachers. Teachers with a master's degree assigned a heavier weight to the dimensions of communication self-efficacy and learning-transfer self-efficacy than did teachers with a bachelor's degree. This study made two additional findings: the fewer teaching years a teacher had, the higher the teacher's communication self-efficacy tended to be; and the more teaching years a teacher had, the higher the teacher's self-directed learning tended to be. Suggestions for further research are provided.\",\n",

Informed by a critical literature synthesis from the fields of cognitive science, history, philosophy, education, technology, ethics, and library science, this analysis situates learning analytics in the context of communication and education technologies as tools in the manipulation of attention. The article begins by defining attention as both a cognitive activity and a metaphysical state intrinsic to intellectual freedom. The Progressive Era concept of attention engineering is then introduced and reinterpreted in the context of attention scarcity and academic capitalism in the Knowledge Era. The affordances of information and communications technology replicated in educational technology to facilitate data capture, analysis, and intervention in the form of \\u201cnudge\\u201d learning analytics are outlined as evidence of contemporary attention engineering in education. Attention engineering in education is critiqued as antithetical to students\\u2019 intellectual freedom and development as self-sufficient learners and independent thinkers. The academic library\\u2019s role in teaching and promoting attentional literacy and attentional autonomy is explored as a response to the intellectual freedom challenges posed by learning analytics as a form of attention engineering.\",\n",

A socially constructed view of technology aims to recognise the culture of technology. Technology education as expressed in the New Zealand curriculum provides an opportunity for societal issues to have equal space with technological capability and technological knowledge. However, when technological activities focus on solutions it is all too easy for stakeholders' positions to be ignored. There is a need for a teaching approach to engage in a liberating technological literacy discourse where values and beliefs of all participants directly and indirectly involved in the activity, are examined. This research monitored a professional development programme where identification of the values represented in a familiar object provided a model for discussion and the development of a teaching environment that promoted consideration of values during problem-solving. The data have been collected from primary school teachers who developed teaching programmes for Years 1 to 8 (5--12 years).

However, lack of agricultural finance is one of numerous challenges they face for improving productivity and increasing income along the value chain. The objectives of this paper were to determine the factors influencing the farmers\\u2019 decision to participate and use agricultural value chain financing in Rwanda and to analyse the constraints hindering smallholder farmers\\u2019 decision to participate and use agricultural value chain financing in Rwanda. Cross sectional data were collected from a random sample of 585 smallholder potato farmers in Musanze and Nyabihu Districts. Results of probit model revealed that sex, age, marital status, education, farming experience, membership to farming associations, household income and distance to market significantly influence the farmers\\u2019 decision to participate and use of agricultural value chain financing. The study also found that financing agricultural activities remain a key challenge for smallholder potato farmers. Fear of borrowing, lack of financial literacy, lack of skills in budgeting and unexpected production, interest rate and others loans charges, lack of collaterals, short repayment period and lack of financial literacy have been found to be the main factors constraining potato farmers\\u2019 participation and use of agricultural value chain financing. Nevertheless, potato productivity will always result from the interaction between all potato value chain actors. The study recommended the government and value chain stakeholders to formulate integrated policies that facilitate smallholder farmers to access to convenient financing products in order to improve productivity and to meet the customer demands.

      "      \"abstract\": \"The active participation of teachers in designing classroom learning experiences contributes to teacher abilities to facilitate learning. This paper reports on a case study of one Dutch teacher designing a technology-rich learning environment for emergent literacy. Data were collected to explore the design and implementation of the learning environment, respectively. The main findings from the design study are that scaffolding teacher design: takes mammoth effort; appears to contribute to teacher learning; yields usable products and ownership, both of which seem to contribute to classroom implementation, but also yields products whose subject matter quality is questionable. The pre-post test data from the implementation study indicate that all children working with the intervention exhibited significant learning gains. Based on the findings, it is hypothesized that the high degree of teacher ownership which stems from designing classroom materials positively influences integration of on-computer activities with off-computer classroom activities, and that a high level of integration yields positive influence on pupil learning about the functions of written language. This rich, but small scale study points to the need for more refined understanding of the gap between what teachers have already mastered and what they can achieve when provided with support, when engaging in technology-rich classroom innovation. We therefore call for innovation design to not only meet learner needs, but also to fit explicitly within a teacher's 'technological zone of proximal development'.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In this end piece, the authors argue that while this special issue shifts debates on the digital divide to address students' capacity to use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for productive social purposes, access to ICT remains a major challenge in countries like Uganda, in which less than 1% of the population has access to the Internet. However, since the case studies address marginalised communities in Australia, Brazil, Greece and South Africa, the findings have relevance to Uganda and other developing countries. Five lessons, in particular, are important for curriculum planning and policy development in Uganda: the need to collect empirical data on ICT access and use; the importance of recognising local differences across rural and urban communities, male and female students; the need to promote professional development of teachers so that they can make effective use of ICT in classrooms; the importance of integrating in and out-of-school digital literacy practices; and the need to consider how global software can best be adapted for local use. The authors conclude that if ICT is to play its part in achieving Education for All by 2015, there is an urgent need for collaborative partnerships between a wide range of stakeholders at both the local and global level.\",\n",

The significance of ICT can be seen from the fact that it has penetrated almost every aspect of our daily lives from business to leisure and even society and social development. The 21st century will bring about an all-embracing convergence of computing, communications and informations. This explosion of technology is changing the banking industry from paper and branch banks to digitized and networked banking services. All over the world, banks are still struggling to find a technological solution to meet the challenges of a rapidly-changing environment.

      "      \"abstract\": \"This study examined the evolution of individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) from childhood to adulthood. Seventy-two adults with a diagnosis of CP born between 1934 and 1980 were studied. Individuals were recruited and data comprehensively collected using case notes and through direct assessments of the majority of participants from three rehabilitation units in Bologna, Padua, and Rovigo in Italy. The main findings can be summarized as follows: contact with health and rehabilitation services was radically reduced once individuals reached adulthood; more individuals who were integrated into mainstream schools achieved and maintained literacy than those who had attended special schools; in a high number of participants, motor performance deteriorated once into adulthood. Independent walking or other forms of supported locomotion were lost in many on reaching adulthood. Of those who continued to walk, walking deteriorated in terms of distance. It was concluded that even though CP has been considered as predominantly a childhood pathological condition, the evolution of the effects of CP do not stop at 16 or 18 years of age. For this reason, the traditional child- (or infant-) oriented approach concentrating mainly or exclusively on the achievement of independent walking, may not be an ideal approach to children with CP. Instead a more independence-oriented therapeutic approach would be appropriate.\",\n",

The present study investigates perceived success and how it is related to corporate finance professionals\\u2019 information source use behavior based on a Web survey of 92 Finnish corporate finance professionals. The principal finding of the statistical analysis of the data is that perceptions of work success and specific types of information sources contributing to the success are related. The correlations are complex, and very different types of information sources contribute to individual types of success, and vice versa. The findings indicate that information sources function as measures of success and serve an instrumental purpose. Besides functional relations, the correlation of the variables suggests more comprehensive success and information source use related dependencies and preferences. The findings imply that by studying existing perceptions of success, it is possible to make inferences about preferred information sources. The study also suggests that both personal and organizational perceptions of success should be taken into account when planning information services and information literacy education for corporate finance professionals to increase their effectiveness and relevance for the professionals.</p>\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This Ofsted guidance for inspectors includes the school library for the first time, addressing the fact that comments in inspection reports often give too little emphasis to the school library's role in the school's curriculum provision, suggesting its role is peripheral. To avoid this, the guidance states that comments about school libraries should be backed up by references to its contribution to pupils learning and achievements. Reference to the library should be made at any point in the report where it has a significant impact (positive or negative) on pupils' standards and quality of achievement. Inspectors should find out what reference was made to the library, if any, in the last report and explore what progress has been made on any action points. It there is little mention of the contribution of the library, the inspector should consider prioritising this as an aspect of provision to explore. Guidance also suggests that data about expenditure on books should be examined as this may signal strong or weak investment in the library and wider book stock. Specific consideration should also be given to how well the library is used in meeting the objectives of the National Literacy Strategy and the English Framework.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In post-Bologna Europe, there has been a noticeable increase in English-medium instruction. In this article we take the case of Sweden as an illustrative example of the wider disciplinary issues involved in changing the teaching language in this way. By 2008 the use of English in Swedish higher education had risen to such an extent that it had to be regulated at the governmental level and through university language policies. Such policies have attempted to provide generalised pragmatic guidelines for language use across educational programmes. In this paper we argue that such general policies fail to take into consideration fundamental disciplinary differences and their potential impact on language use. We present a theoretical argument about the knowledge structures of disciplines, relating these to the disciplinary literacy goals of educational programmes. We then illustrate our argument using data from an extensive survey carried out at a major Swedish university. We conclude that the disciplinary variation in the use of English can be seen as a product of different knowledge-making practices and educational goals. This conclusion problematises \\u201cone-size-fits-all\\u201d language policies which only deal with general features of language use and do not allow for discipline-specific adjustments.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Emerging as a discipline in the first half of the twentieth century, the information sciences study how people, groups, organizations, and governments create, share, disseminate, manage, search, access, evaluate, and protect information, as well as how different technologies and policies can facilitate and constrain these activities. Given the broad span of the information sciences, it is perhaps not surprising that there is no consensus regarding its underlying theory the purposes of it, the types of it, or how one goes about developing new theories to talk about new research questions.Diane H. Sonnenwald and the contributors to this volume seek to shed light on these issues by sharing reflections on the theory-development process. These reflections are not meant to revolve around data collection and analysis; rather, they focus on the struggles, challenges, successes, and excitement of developing theories. The particular theories that the contributors explore in their essays range widely, from theories of literacy and reading to theories of design and digital search. Several chapters engage with theories of the behavior of individuals and groups; some deal with processes of evaluation; others reflect on questions of design; and the rest treat cultural and scientific heritage. The ultimate goal, Sonnenwald writes in her introduction, is to \\\"encourage, inspire, and assist individuals striving to develop and/or teach theory development.\\\"\\\"\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"At the heart of any discussion of the information sciences, at least when this discussion is held in the English language, lies the problem of the variant, and shifting, set of concepts and meanings of the terms 'library' and 'information'. The term 'information', in particular, has a variety of meanings in different contexts and communities of discourse, providing an excellent example of Wittgenstein's language game. This implies that any terminology built around this central concept is in danger of being constructed on 'shifting sands'. This article outlines, for the English language only, some of these diverse meanings of information, and their consequences for the terminology of the information sciences. It focuses on the variant relationships between information and related concepts, particularly data and knowledge. It also includes an account of the view information taken in the hard and soft methodologies of system science, as well as the new discipline of 'information physics'. From this, some remarks may be made on the changing meanings of the complex terms such as 'information technology' and 'information literacy', as well as those complex terms involving 'management', information management, knowledge management, document management etc. A similar, though shorter, treatment will de given to terminology around the 'library' concept, particularly in view of the change toward viewing a library as an organised virtual information space, rather than physical environment.\",\n",

This paper examines green initiatives within the context of Nigerian libraries with emphasis on analysis of related policy and practice of green librarianship, and pluses and minuses of Nigerian libraries in the green initiatives. The result of a survey of librarians in Nigeria is presented. A four-dimensional, cross-sectional research design was adopted for the study which combined library search, interview, participant observation and a 10-item survey questionnaire using the Surveymonkey tool for data collection. The questionnaire was administered on librarians registered in the Nigerian Library Association (NLA) Online Forum. It sought to investigate the level of awareness of librarians of greening, attitude to greening libraries, efforts at greening libraries, greening policy in the libraries and ways of further advancing greening for sustainable development. Preliminary findings from the literature search indicated that there is an exciting emergent library discourse on \\u201cgreen\\u201d policy and actions, however, Nigerian libraries are implementing \\u201cgreen\\u201d measures at minimal level and rather unconsciously. The level of awareness of greening initiatives among Nigerian librarians is still relatively low and the recommendations of this study calls for increased awareness and environmental literacy among library users and the entire community to build better green momentum in Nigerian libraries.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The aim of this research is to look into the current situation and difficulties that the compliance department faces in ensuring compliance in Bangladesh's Ready Made Garments industry. Data are gathered using a formal questionnaire from the compliance department of the garments industry, which is in charge of addressing compliance concerns in the workplace. According to the report, the garments industry faces the least difficulty in removing child labor in the workplace, followed by welfare services, workplace protection, workplace conditions, health care, and so on. The garments industry has found that freedom of association, workplace health and safety training, violence and bullying, and extended working hours are the most difficult issues to deal with inside factory premises. It also shows that the most significant obstacle for top management in implementing enforcement is a lack of top-level funding, which is accompanied by a lack of worker knowledge of their rights, a lack of government involvement, and inadequate worker literacy. The results suggest that the garment owners need to change their mindset from pure benefit to a long-term enterprise focused on justice and quality. Governments, non-governmental organizations, and labor unions all have a role to play in informing employers of their interests. Via preparation, dialogue, and fair and periodic inspections, the government should show a firm commitment to enforcing the laws.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Objective \\u2013 Evidence from systematic reviews a decade ago suggested that face-to-face and online methods to provide information literacy training in universities were equally effective in terms of skills learnt, but there was a lack of robust comparative research. The objectives of this review were (1) to update these findings with the inclusion of more recent primary research; (2) to further enhance the summary of existing evidence by including studies of blended formats (with components of both online and face-to-face teaching) compared to single format education; and (3) to explore student views on the various formats employed.&\\\\#13; &\\\\#13; Methods \\u2013 Authors searched seven databases along with a range of supplementary search methods to identify comparative research studies, dated January 1995 to October 2016, exploring skill outcomes for students enrolled in higher education programs. There were 33 studies included, of which 19 also contained comparative data on student views. Where feasible, meta-analyses were carried out to provide summary estimates of skills development and a thematic analysis was completed to identify student views across the different formats.&\\\\#13; &\\\\#13; Results \\u2013 A large majority of studies (27 of 33; 82\\\\%) found no statistically significant difference between formats in skills outcomes for students. Of 13 studies that could be included in a meta-analysis, the standardized mean difference (SMD) between skill test results for face-to-face versus online formats was -0.01 (95\\\\% confidence interval -0.28 to 0.26). Of ten studies comparing blended to single delivery format, seven (70\\\\%) found no statistically significant difference between formats, and the remaining studies had mixed outcomes. From the limited evidence available across all studies, there is a potential dichotomy between outcomes measured via skill test and assignment (course work) which is worthy of further investigation. The thematic analysis of student views found no preference in relation to format on a range of measures in 14 of 19 studies (74\\\\%). The remainder identified that students perceived advantages and disadvantages for each format but had no overall preference.&\\\\#13; &\\\\#13; Conclusions \\u2013 There is compelling evidence that information literacy training is effective and well received across a range of delivery formats. Further research looking at blended versus single format methods, and the time implications for each, as well as comparing assignment to skill test outcomes would be valuable. Future studies should adopt a methodologically robust design (such as the randomized controlled trial) with a large student population and validated outcome measures.\\\\textless/p\\\\textgreater\",\n",

However, not all book types may be equally beneficial, with paper book reading more strongly associated with literacy benefit than screen-based reading at this stage, and a paucity of research in this area. While children in developed countries are gaining ever-increasing levels of access to devices at home, relatively little is known about the influence of access to devices with eReading capability, such as Kindles, iPads, computers and mobile phones, on young children's reading behaviours, and the extent to which these devices are used for reading purposes when access is available. Young people are gaining increasing access to devices through school-promoted programs; parents face aggressive marketing to stay abreast of educational technologies at home; and schools and libraries are increasingly their eBook collections, often at the expense of paper book collections. Data from the 997 children who participated in the 2016 Western Australian Study in Children's Book Reading were analysed to determine children's level of access to devices with eReading capability, and their frequency of use of these devices in relation to their recreational book reading frequency. Respondents were found to generally underutilise devices for reading purposes, even when they were daily book readers. In addition, access to mobile phones was associated with reading infrequency. It was also found that reading frequency was less when children had access to a greater range of these devices.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The automatic translation of the Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS) into Portuguese is a very complex problem, due to the peculiarities and characteristics of this sign language. Several researches have already been carried out and important results have been obtained. However, most of the proposed methods recognize only letters and numbers, or a reduced number of words. In addition, due to such limitations, the results of these researches are still insufficient to enable communication with deaf people without the dependency of interpreters, and basic services such as education and health need these professionals to meet the demand for care of the hearing impaired. Another problem faced on trying to envision solutions is the lack of a public database containing a significant number of signals, labeled by experts in this area. Finally, deep learning techniques have been used to solve many computer vision problems, but we have not found any work directly related to the automatic classification of LIBRAS. In light of these observations, this work uses a method based on deep convolutional 3D neural network, extracted spatiotemporal characteristics, strategy of transfer learning and depth data associated with RGB, to perform the classification of the most common LIBRAS signs used in the literacy of deaf people. In addition, another important contribution is the generated labeled database, composed of 510 instances, all representing dynamic signals, given that there is no LIBRAS database available with such an amount of samples.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"he U.S. Military Academy (USMA) at West Point is responsible for developing in its graduates literacy in the sciences that renders them capable of solving complex real-world problems. Throughout their careers as officers in the military, graduates will be called upon to view the physical world in a disciplined and objective manner, with an ability to infer causal relationships through careful observation and to recognize scientific challenges and opportunities when confronting complex problems. The study of mathematics and science cultivates modes of thought that can provide a foundation for intellectual development across all disciplines. Scientifically literate Army officers need to possess an understanding of the fundamental principles of the basic sciences, to view the physical world in a disciplined and objective manner through careful observation of causal relationships interpreted within a framework of physical laws, and to have the intellectual foundation to recognize scientific challenges and opportunities when confronting complex problems. The Math and Science Goal Team, composed of faculty from several disciplines, has developed standards for each of the desired math and science outcomes and identified embedded indicators in the eleven math and science courses of the core curriculum that map to the outcomes. The goal team first examined cadets' ability to discern the scientific features or aspects of complex problems. The team developed an assessment rubric aligned with the goal standard and then determined that a laboratory report in a required second-level physics course was an ideal embedded indicator with which to measure cadet performance. The data reported by the goal team indicate that by the midpoint of their academic careers, the majority of cadets have met the standards of the math and science goal. Company commanders, battalion commanders, and recent graduates all provide positive assessments of math and science goal achievement. These four sources of data together indicate that the USMA continues to provide the Army with officers who have the necessary math and science skills.\",\n",

In the light of these developments, health care providers need to have a closer look at the perception of their patients and try to provide quality medical and health services to meet their expectations. In this study the researcher tries to identify the Service Quality Gap for the Multispecialty hospitals in Chennai City. SERVQUAL instrument is the used to measure the patient satisfaction. Five dimensions in service quality (Servqual), tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, empathy, and assurance (Parasuraman, Zeithamal, &Berry, 1985) is considered for this research. Using Multi stage sampling method, the samples were selected. The data required was collected through the structured SERVQUAL questionnaire and then it was analyzed using SPSS with Chi-square test, Multiple Regressions, Paired t Test, Reliability test. The results showed that patient's expectations had not been met in any of the examined dimensions and their consent has not been achieved. It seemed that necessary for managers and relevant authorities to plan and pay special attention to this important issue.

The evaluation system of curriculum quality should be built around ten evaluation dimensions, such as teaching objectives, subject frontier, case teaching, teacher literacy, classroom discussion, teaching methods, teaching courseware, information technology, teachers Q and A, curriculum ideological and political. Taking the students of school of physics and electronic information of Nanchang Normal University as the research object, and the sample size of curriculum quality evaluation is 5443, the Pearson correlation analysis is carried out on ten evaluation dimensions, and the correlation coefficient is 0.770, which indicates strong positive correlation. A regression model with ten evaluation dimensions as independent variables and curriculum satisfaction as dependent variables is established. The resolution of the model is 77.4 , which can predict curriculum satisfaction, and which has theoretical support for teachers to pay attention to the curriculum quality and improve the curriculum quality. It emphasizes that teaching department should pay attention to the effect of evaluation results on the continuous improvement of curriculum quality. It is suggested that a substantial and effective mechanism for continuous improvement should be established.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Guiding students to library resources, and supporting users in their discovery and use, is a key role of academic librarians. Subject pages are a traditional way of asynchronously managing some of the complexity that exists, with off-the-shelf software packages often a solution. The University of Portsmouth Library (https://library.port.ac.uk/) decided to provide this support through an addition to our existing in-house content management system (CMS). This would be flexible and powerful in allowing freedom of design for Faculty Librarians within a shell that provided some similarity \\u2013 and thus familiarity \\u2013 between subject areas. It would also be easy to maintain technically. The Library's Web Developer, in consultation with the six Faculty Librarians and the Enquiry team lead, has built a PHP/MySQL based application which is tightly integrated to our existing web resources providing enhanced delivery mechanisms allowing for open ended content development while retaining support for legacy web pages. This allows new pages to be quickly and easily added to the system in real time, existing pages to be either edited alone, \\u2018linked to\\u2019 or copied and modified. Resource lists can be simply constructed which rely on Library metadata rather than copies of data which need updating; support material can be added whether video, slides or images; guidance can be included to help students navigate their information literacy journey. Despite a pressured summer period of lockdown and working from home due to Covid-19, the rollout of the system has been successful from the point of view of the faculty librarian construction and development, as well as in usage by our enquiries team supporting students requiring help. Student feedback has been positive.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Education is the most important vehicle for social, economic and political transformation. Unfortunately, globally numerous Physically Challenged Persons (PCPs) and particularly Children with Disabilities (CWDs) do not get adequate opportunity of education because of social neglect, and absence of support systems in the home and inadequacy of sufficient facilities particularly in schools. The situation is worst for low-income countries compare to high-income countries. In India, as for all children, education is vital for CWDs in itself but also instrumental for participating in employment and other areas of social activity. However, educational outcomes for children and adults with disabilities remain poor in both rural and urban India. The circumstance is more vulnerable for girl children with disability. The situation is started to change. The NSSO data shows some improvement in literacy level. The MHRD has introduced various programmes to provide educational opportunities to PCPs in an inclusive environment and emphasize on the requirement of appropriate vocational training skills to make them self reliant and productive members of the society. But, the coverage under the scheme has remained limited. Eventually, CWDs should have equal access to quality education, because this is key to human capital formation and their participation in social and economic life.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Contemporary learning networks involve a complex mix of tools, tasks and people, in varied assemblages, distributed across time and space. This interweaving generates particular challenges for analysing and designing for networked learning. The use of design patterns and pattern languages, originally developed by architect Christopher Alexander to reveal and then represent and share design knowledge, has now been adopted to facilitate and support such educational design work. The research reported in this thesis adopts and then extends this approach. It examines the architectures of two learning networks within the field of adult literacy education: one for students and the other for the professional development of educators. Adult literacy has tended to be a neglected area in comparison with other areas of education research. As such the practical purpose of this thesis is to identify good design solutions able to be applied within this educational domain. As the research progressed, a central focus developed: to find a way to account for, in the practical use of pattern theory within education, the deeper philosophical basis of Alexander\\u2019s approach - concerning quality and value. The research data come from the analysis of digital and physical artefacts, direct participation in learning programs, observations, and interviews with diverse stakeholders in the learning networks. An initial network analysis was undertaken, grounded in the Activity Centred Analysis and Design framework, which is informed by socio-material theories of learning. This helped develop an understanding of the complex relations between learning activity and the (hybrid) environments in which it occurs. However, while these relational-material theories importantly acknowledge that \\u2018matter matters\\u2019, when it comes to making sense of human action they tend to embrace a \\u2018conventional\\u2019 picture of matter as essentially \\u2018dead\\u2019 and separated from the human self. This understanding contrasts with the approach espoused by Alexander (2002-2005) in his later work into the nature of \\u2018order\\u2019. My research draws on this now very extensive later work, to advance a new framework for educational design that directly embodies the fundamental \\u2013 and essential \\u2013 socio-political values inherent in education. In doing so it supports the deployment of pattern theory in a way that is consistent with its deep philosophical underpinnings. In adopting this approach, the study identifies various design elements that only occasionally and/or ephemerally \\u2018materialize\\u2019 around the core parts of a network \\u2013 elements which therefore tend to be less prominent and are often missed, but which nevertheless show intricate and critical connections among the core activities taking place. This thesis argues that unless such relations are unveiled and understood, the essential core of a learning network cannot be entirely grasped and the resultant (simplified) abstracted design patterns prove insufficient to inform the creation of effective education designs. The study findings suggest that the more holistic approach enabled by the extended framing developed in this thesis (referred to here, drawing on the influential work of Paulo Freire, as a pedagogy of wholeness) is highly effective for revealing these often elusive, yet critical design patterns. In connecting Freire\\u2019s and Alexander\\u2019s philosophies, pedagogy of wholeness is as concerned with sound pedagogical design as it is with how designs for learning can contribute to the design of a more loving world.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In this end piece, we argue that while this special issue shifts debates on the digital divide to address students' capacity to use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for productive social purposes, access to ICT remains a major challenge in countries like Uganda, in which less than 1%of the population has access to the Internet. However, since the case studies address marginalised communities in Australia, Brazil, Greece and South Africa, the findings have relevance to Uganda and other developing countries. Five lessons, in particular, are important for curriculum planning and policy development in Uganda: the need to collect empirical data on ICT access and use; the importance of recognising local differences across rural and urban communities, male and female students; the need to promote professional development of teachers so that they can make effective use of ICT in classrooms; the importance of integrating in and out-of-school digital literacy practices; and the need to consider how global software can best be adapted for local use. We conclude that if ICT is to play its part in achieving Education for All by 2015, there is an urgent need for collaborative partnerships between a wide range of stakeholders at both the local and global level.

For such educational research, we have made use of the thoroughly projected combina-\\r\\ntion of the intervention design and qualitative non-participant unstructured observations \\u2013 within\\r\\nthe framework of the design-based research methodology.\\r\\n   In this paper we present our initial assumptions and inspirations, methods of our research work\\r\\nand major observations, we clarify what investigative on-line activities are and how we have col-\\r\\nlected and analyzed data obtained by observing students while solving the investigative tasks. In our\\r\\nresearch we have focused on the development of three classes of competencies, namely digital com-\\r\\npetencies (i.e., those that pertain to the area of general digital literacy), computational competencies\\r\\n(i.e., those that correspond to the goals of informatics in education) and social competencies (i.e.,\\r\\nthose that allow students to communicate, cooperate, create or evaluate their own doings, learning\\r\\netc.). In our paper we present corresponding observations and also attitudes and reactions of the\\r\\nteachers \\u2013 who have been involved merely as supervisors, not as members of the teams.

      "      \"abstract\": \"According to statistics, more than 90 of Chinese universities have offered advanced mathematics for liberal arts students as a general course since 2003 to cultivate their scientific literacy and problem solving ability. This study aims to provide a feasible approach for liberal arts students to accept the value of mathematics and apply mathematical methods to academic research and real world problems solution. In the Applied Probability and Statistics class with the attendance of 154 liberal arts freshmen, this study is designed to discuss and value on the five mathematics application reports as examples. Then liberal arts students were interviewed on evaluating these 5 mathematics application reports. 28 mathematics application reports were completed by 154 students in groups and cooperation, which were analyzed on how mathematics was incorporated into their reports. The qualitative analysis of the interview results found that the discussion and evaluation of these 5 mathematics application reports about applying mathematics and solving social problems can stimulate liberal arts students' interest in mathematics and realize the value of mathematics application. Therefore, peer mathematics application is a way for liberal arts students to realize mathematics value. Through the classification analysis of the 28 mathematics application reports completed by the liberal arts students, their three forms of mathematics application can be summarized as follows applying the regularity of mathematical argument instead of the special case of the practice test in social cognition using data analysis to monitor the probabilities of plausible reasoning developing their applied mathematical ability to solve daily life problems.

Brain lesions\\r\\n\\tin patients with pure alexia and functional imaging data suggest\\r\\n\\tthat the VWF is subtended by a restricted patch of left-hemispheric\\r\\n\\tfusiform cortex, which is reproducibly activated during reading.\\r\\n\\tIn order to determine whether the operation of this Visual Word Form\\r\\n\\tArea (VWFA) depends exclusively on the visual features of stimuli,\\r\\n\\tor is influenced by language-dependent parameters, brain activations\\r\\n\\tinduced by words, consonant strings and chequerboards were compared\\r\\n\\tin normal subjects using functional MRI (fMRI). Stimuli were presented\\r\\n\\tin the left or right visual hemifield. The VWFA was identified in\\r\\n\\tboth a blocked-design experiment and an event-related experiment\\r\\n\\tas a left-hemispheric inferotemporal area showing a stronger activation\\r\\n\\tto alphabetic strings than to chequerboards, and invariant for the\\r\\n\\tspatial location of stimuli. In both experiments, stronger activations\\r\\n\\tof the VWFA to words than to strings of consonants were observed.\\r\\n\\tConsidering that the VWFA is equally activated by real words and\\r\\n\\tby readable pseudowords, this result demonstrates that the VWFA is\\r\\n\\tinitially plastic and becomes attuned to the orthographic regularities\\r\\n\\tthat constrain letter combination during the acquisition of literacy.\\r\\n\\tAdditionally, the use of split-field stimulation shed some light\\r\\n\\ton the cerebral bases of the classical right visual field (RVF) advantage\\r\\n\\tin reading. A left occipital extrastriate area was found to be activated\\r\\n\\tby RVF letter strings more than by chequerboards, while no symmetrical\\r\\n\\tregion was observed in the right hemisphere. Moreover, activations\\r\\n\\tin the precuneus and the left thalamus were observed when subjects\\r\\n\\twere reading RVF versus left visual field (LVF) words, and are likely\\r\\n\\tto reflect the attentional component of the RVF advantage.\",\n",

In this State of the Field&#xD;&#xA;study our goal was to conduct an objective and comprehensive review of learning analytics in order to&#xD;&#xA;summarise the field by answering the following questions: What are the main research themes within&#xD;&#xA;the field of learning analytics? What data and methods are being used? and What are the&#xD;&#xA;characteristics of the learning analytics studies?&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The combined proceedings of the Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) conferences from&#xD;&#xA;2011-2015 were used to generate a set of search terms for a systematic search for relevant articles.&#xD;&#xA;In collaboration with the Knowledge Centre for Education (Kunnskapssenter for Utdanning) our search&#xD;&#xA;produced 796 articles, which after a systematic reduction resulted in a corpus of 100 articles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A thematic analysis was carried out to identify the primary research themes that have emerged. These&#xD;&#xA;included: algorithms and models, data, predictive analysis, learning analytics for educators, learning&#xD;&#xA;analytics for institutions, network analysis, tool development, visualisations, overviews, text analysis,&#xD;&#xA;and ethics, philosophy &amp; policy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of the corpus showed that&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;learning analytics is a wide field with articles published in education, computer science, and&#xD;&#xA;psychology journals&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;the research is data rich, but theory poor&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;the majority of the research has been carried out in higher education&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;predictive analysis is a very popular research area addressing HE institutional problems such as&#xD;&#xA;dropouts, retention, and curriculum issues&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;predictive models/algorithms are situation dependent and there is little evidence that they are&#xD;&#xA;transferable between different contexts&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also a number of gaps in the research on learning analytics:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#x9;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the application of learning analytics in K-12 education (at macro, meso, micro levels)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;research on everyday analytics in classrooms (i.e., how do we collect data in classrooms)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;research on assessment/feedback&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;research on learning-centric analytics, as opposed to learner-centric analytics&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;Implementation and impact of learning analytics&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;data literacy, although there are a few studies addressing whether or not stakeholders can&#xD;&#xA;understand the visualisations they are presented.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;\",\n",

How do we interpret such events? In this article, we critique a representational mode of interpretation and describe an alternate mode. We argue that literacy performances are often about creating differences, including differences in the moving, shifting relations of semiotic resources and differences in the performed identities of participants. Such differences\\u2014effects and affective intensities\\u2014are lost or overly stabilized within conventional interpretations, which focus on asking how meanings are represented, organized, and produced in performances. Conventionally, the texts of performances (e.g., print, images, speech) are imagined to signify (or re-present) a world that lies behind them. The task of interpretation is approached as reading for meaning. In this mode, we conceive of performances as primarily communicational or informational. Alternatively, using rhizomatic analysis, we follow the emergence of relations and differences by mapping performance-in-motion. We discuss how rhizomatic analysis shifts attention away from fixed meanings and toward action and the new \\u201cbecomings\\u201d that are an important part of literacy performances. Data are drawn from an ethnographic study of interactions in a socially, culturally, and racially diverse high school American Studies classroom.En las actividades de alfabetizaci\\u00f3n en el aula los estudiantes tienen un desempe\\u00f1o p\\u00fablico en el que usan diversos textos, movimientos corporales e interacciones verbales. \\u00bfDe qu\\u00e9 modo interpretamos esos eventos?

Konventionell gilt, dass die Texte der Auff\\u00fchrungen (d.h.

Science & Technology Libraries, 34(3), 272-286. http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0194262X.2015.1090941 Objective \\u2013 To investigate the engineering faculty's information-seeking behaviour, experiences, awareness, and use of the university library. Design \\u2013 Web-based survey questionnaire. Setting \\u2013 The main campus of a state university in the United States of America. Subjects \\u2013 119 faculty members within 8 engineering departments. Methods \\u2013 An email invitation to participate in a 16-item electronic survey questionnaire, with questions related to library use, was sent in the spring of 2015 to 119 engineering faculty members. Faculty were given 24 days to complete the survey, and a reminder email was sent 10 days after the original survey invitation. Main Results \\u2013 Thirty-eight faculty members responded to the survey, representing a response rate of 32\\\\%. Overall, faculty had a high level of use and awareness of both online and physical library resources and services, although their awareness of certain scholarly communication services, such as data archiving and copyright advisory, was significantly lower. Faculty tend to turn to Google and Google Scholar when searching for information rather than turning to library databases. Faculty do not use social media to keep up with library news and updates. The library website, as well as liaison librarians, were cited as the primary sources for this type of information. Conclusions \\u2013 The researcher concludes that librarians need to do a better job of marketing library resources, such as discipline-specific databases, as well as other library search tools. Because faculty use web search engines as a significant source of information, the author proposes further research on this behaviour, and suggests more action to educate faculty on different search tools, their limitations, and effective use. As faculty indicated a general lack of interest in integrating information literacy into their classes, the researcher notes that librarians need to find ways to persuade faculty that this type of integrated instruction is beneficial for students' learning and research needs. Faculty were aware of the library liaison program, so this baseline relationship between faculty and librarian can serve as an opportunity to build upon current liaison services and responsibilities.\\\\textless/p\\\\textgreater\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This study examined the relationship between the young aged about 14 and information technology as well as the factors related from the perspective of the young. The research lasted two years and its empirical data is based on the information given by about 400 young people. The young participating in this research represented the whole age group in a geographically limited area. On the basis of the data acquisition events the research process can be divided into five phases depending on each other. In this report the research process is represented chronologically in the same order as it was carried out in practise. The main aim of this study was to construct an instrument to measure the young people s beliefs and attitudes related to information technology. Two different instruments were developed and tested for this purpose during the study. The development of the first scale was based on the items borrowed from the scales measuring mainly the adult real world. The first scale was developed and tested with the data from two different surveys. In the exploratory factor analysis, contrary to the presumptions, the benefit and status dimensions did not separate into their own factors. In addition the attitudes towards computers separated into two different factors, one of which represented a positive and the other a negative attitude towards information technology. The scale didn t separate the young in the area of computer anxiety either. Because of the observed deficiencies in the first scale the development of another scale was begun by mapping the research area first with the help of the quantitative material and by using both a comparable group and adult experts to select items for the second scale. The five presumed dimensions, attitude, usefulness, status, self-efficacy and anxiety separated into their own factors in the factor analytic qualification of the scale. The aim was to construct a wide scale but it remained quite narrow because after cleaning only four items were left for each dimension. Concerning the attitude towards computers the developed scale gave the girls and boys almost the same values, which is an exceptional result even internationally examined. The functionality of the scale was tested by models used and tested in earlier studies. On the basis of fit parameters different models worked quite well but their explanation rate variance was not very high.\\r\\nIn addition to the development work of the scale, another aim of the study was to acquire and analyse real-time information on the relationship between the young and information technology. On the basis of the data the young use information technology mainly at home as consumers for hedonistic purposes. No major differences were observed in the use of information technology between the boys and girls but structurally network communication was characteristic of girls whereas computer games interested the boys more. The home proved to be an important place also for informal learning about information technology. The study also analysed the factors affecting the development of the young becoming an expert in information technology. Signs of digital generation gaps related to information technology turned up between parents and children. The biggest inequality among the young was caused by the lack of broadband access still in about every fifth home. The opportunity to use information technology outside home, e.g. as an optional school subject, didn t in practice compensate the opportunity to use information technology at home. One purpose of this study was to approach the question also asked in the title of PISA (2005) report:  Are Students Really Ready for a Technology-Rich World?  This study didn t give an unambiguous answer to the question either, but hopefully it gave at least some partial grounds for formulating the answer. It is suggested in the study that research of informal learning related to information technology should be increased and tests to measure the digital literacy of the young should be developed.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"University of Technology Sydney. Connected Intelligence Centre., Learning Analytics (LA) is a new promising field that is attracting the attention of education providers and a range of stakeholders including teachers, learning designers, academic directors and data scientists. Researchers and practitioners are interested in learning analytics as it can provide insights from student data about learning processes, learners who may need more help, and learners\\u2019 behaviours and strategies. However, problems such as low educator satisfaction, steep learning curves, misalignment between the analytics and pedagogical approaches, lack of engagement with learning technologies and other barriers to learning analytics development have already been reported. From a human-centred design perspective, these problems can be explained due to the lack of stakeholders\\u2019 involvement in the design of the LA tools. In particular, learners and teachers are commonly not considered as active agents of the LA design process. Including teachers, learners, developers and other stakeholders as collaborators in the &#x1d624;&#x1d630;-&#x1d625;&#x1d626;&#x1d634;&#x1d62a;&#x1d628;&#x1d62f; of LA innovations can bring promising benefits in democratising the LA design process, aligning analytics and pedagogy, and meeting stakeholders\\u2019 expectations. Yet, working in collaboration with stakeholders to design LA innovations opens a series of questions that are addressed in this thesis in order to contribute to closing the gap for effective co-design of LA innovations. The questions addressed in this thesis are the following:&#xD;&#xA;1. How can co-design techniques assist in the integration of diverse stakeholders in the LA design process?&#xD;&#xA;2. What are the roles of the co-design practitioner/researcher in the LA design process?&#xD;&#xA;3. What are the challenges in engaging stakeholders in the LA design process?&#xD;&#xA;Based on co-design principles, and following a Design-Based Research process, this thesis explores the critical challenge of engaging educators and students, the non-technical stakeholders who are often neglected, but who should ultimately be the main beneficiaries of LA innovations. In this research work, three case studies have been used to test, analyse and verify various co-design techniques in diverse learning contexts across a university to generate a co-design toolkit and recommendations for other co-design practitioners: i) learners and educators engaged in simulation-based healthcare scenarios, ii) learners, educators and other stakeholders in a Data Science Masters program , and iii) educators interested in providing personalised feedback at scale.&#xD;&#xA;This thesis presents three contributions to knowledge for effectively collaborating with educational stakeholders in the LA co-design process:&#xD;&#xA;1. Inspired by archetypal challenges reported in classic and contemporary co-design literature, and in current LA research, the thesis identifies, exemplifies and reflects on five key challenges for LA co-design: power relationships, surveillance, learning design dependencies, asymmetric teaching/learning expertise, and data literacy.&#xD;&#xA;2. By adopting and adapting well established co-design techniques, across the three case studies, the thesis provides empirical evidence of how these techniques can be used in LA co-design, reflecting on their affordances, and providing guidance on their usage. These detailed findings are distilled into a &#x1d613;&#x1d626;&#x1d622;&#x1d633;&#x1d62f;&#x1d62a;&#x1d62f;&#x1d628; &#x1d608;&#x1d62f;&#x1d622;&#x1d62d;&#x1d63a;&#x1d635;&#x1d62a;&#x1d624;&#x1d634; &#x1d60a;&#x1d630;-&#x1d625;&#x1d626;&#x1d634;&#x1d62a;&#x1d628;&#x1d62f; &#x1d617;&#x1d62d;&#x1d622;&#x1d63a;&#x1d623;&#x1d630;&#x1d630;&#x1d62c;, published under an open license to assist adoption and improvements.&#xD;&#xA;3. Recognising the importance of the co-design practitioner in ensuring that the design process is participatory, the thesis documents and discusses the key functions and skills that this position requires. The role is further complicated when the practitioner is not only a &#x1d627;&#x1d622;&#x1d624;&#x1d62a;&#x1d62d;&#x1d62a;&#x1d635;&#x1d622;&#x1d635;&#x1d630;&#x1d633; serving a project, but also a &#x1d633;&#x1d626;&#x1d634;&#x1d626;&#x1d622;&#x1d633;&#x1d624;&#x1d629;&#x1d626;&#x1d633; of co-design. This motivates guidelines on the role of the co-design practitioner/researcher when working with stakeholders, and simultaneously studying the LA co-design process, tools and methods.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Nearly every decade has its own claim to a revolution that is the biggest since the invention of the printing press. Well, what was that original revolution, still the defending champion of cultural upheavals, actually like? In <I>The Gutenberg Galaxy</I>, University of Toronto theorist Marshall McLuhan described the shift from an oral to a print culture and in the process set off a bit of a revolution of his own. <I>The Gutenberg Galaxy</I>, the first of McLuhan's major books, is also the most accessible, but, as you would expect from the man who told us that \\\"the medium is the message,\\\" it's innovative in style as well as content, structured as a mosaic of short essays, quotes, and aphorisms, one of which introduced the idea of the \\\"global village\\\" to a world that would soon fulfill McLuhan's prophecy. Movable type, as much if not more than any meaningful arrangement of that type, transformed Renaissance consciousness--just as electronic circuitry is transforming us now. That is the basic premise of Marshall McLuhan's <I>The Gutenberg Galaxy</I>. New technologies create new human environments, and \\\"technological environments are not merely passive containers &\\\\#133; but are active processes that reshape people and other technologies alike.\\\" McLuhan's second book, <I>The Gutenberg Galaxy</I> was published in 1962, won the Canadian Governor General's Medal that same year, and pushed McLuhan toward international prominence. Like most of McLuhans's other work--<I>Understanding Media</I> or <I>The Global Village</I>, for example--<I>The Gutenberg Galaxy</I> is a rich, dense text that draws freely, almost frantically, from works of philosophy, economics, political theory, history, and especially literature. There are liberal doses of Shakespeare--text and commentary--sprinkled throughout, as well as trenchant appropriations from Rabelais, Cervantes, Leibnitz, Blake, Joyce, and many others. Attempting to match his medium to his metaphors, McLuhan structures his book using what he calls \\u00e4 mosaic or field approach\\\" and ends up producing more than 100 short sections separated by pithy glosses in large bold type, such as \\\"Schizophrenia may be a necessary consequence of literacy,\\\" or \\\" Nobody ever made a grammatical error in a non-literate society.\\\" Today's reader might find the \\\"mosaic of perpetually interacting forms\\\" into which the author organizes his data and quotations distinctly Web-like. Indeed, one could say of McLuhan and his complex rhetorical circuitry what McLuhan himself says about Shakespeare: \\\"His insights appear so richly in his lines that it is very difficult to select among them.\\\" <I>--Russell Prather</I>\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The present knowledge society requires statistical literacy-the ability to interpret, critically evaluate, and communicate about statistical information and messages (Gal, 2002). However, research shows that students generally do not gain satisfactory statistical understanding. The research presented in this thesis is a sequel to design research carried out by Cobb, McClain, and Gravemeijer (2003) and aims at contributing to an empirically grounded instruction theory for early statistics education in which educational computer tools are used. Computer software allows users to dynamically interact with large data sets and to explore different representations in ways that are impossible by hand. The computer tools used were the Statistical Minitools (Cobb et al., 1997), which have been designed for middle school students. One important end goal of instruction was that students would gain understanding of sampling and learn to use 'shape' to reason about distributions. In line with the theory of Realistic Mathematics Education, a central tenet was that learning mathematics should be a meaningful activity. The research questions were: 1. How can students with little statistical background develop a notion of distribution? 2. How does the process of symbolizing evolve when students learn to reason about distribution? In the latter question, 'symbolizing' refers to the reflexive process of making symbols and mentally constructing the objects which they represent. The design research consisted of five cycles of three phases: a design phase, a teaching experiment, and a retrospective analysis. Prior to these cycles, historical and didactical phenomenological analyses (Freudenthal, 1991) were carried out as well as exploratory interviews. The historical study gave rise to hypotheses that were partially tested in the teaching experiments carried out in grades 7 and 8 (12 to 14 years old). In the design phase, a so-called hypothetical learning trajectory (Simon, 1995) was formulated, which was tested and revised in the subsequent cycles of design research. The recurring activity of discussing growing samples proved useful to support reasoning about distribution and sampling. For the analyses of students' learning, a method was used similar to the constant comparative method (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). It turned out that students conceived distributions as 'bumps' consisting of a small group of low values, a large group of 'average' values, and a small group of high values. Peirce's semiotics proved useful for analyzing students' process of symbolizing, in particular, his notions of hypostatic abstraction and diagrammatic reasoning. Hypostatic abstraction refers to the transition from a predicate to a new abstract object (\\\"the dots are spread out\\\" to \\\"the spread is large\\\"). Diagrammatic reasoning consists of three steps: making a diagram, experimenting with it, and reflecting on the results. The research shows the importance of letting students make their own diagrams and discussing these. The computer tools seemed most useful during the experimentation phase. Remarkably, the best diagrammatic reasoning occurred only during class discussions without computers around. One recommendation is: only invest in using computer tools if all educational factors such as teaching, end goals, instructional activities, tools, and assessment are tuned to each other.\",\n",

      "      \"comment\": \"In many countries pattern recognition and generalisation are considered fundamental to developing mathematical thinking and has thus become important components of mathematics curricula reform. South Africa's new curriculum plans (Curriculum 2005) also emphasises the importance of generalisation as is evident from the following specific outcomes for Mathematical Literacy, Mathematics and Mathematical Sciences: : Most students had no difficulty finding f (7) and f (8) in any of the activities - they either found and used the function rule correctly, or used recursion correctly for these nearby values. However, in trying to find a manageable strategy for finding further-lying function values, children invented a variety of different strategies. While using recursion was successful in extending number patterns to nearby values, students find it tedious for finding larger function values. They then mostly attempted to adapt their recursion strategy in some way, but made many logical errors in the process. Our biggest concern is not so much the fact that students make many errors, but that they do not feel the need, or do not have the know-how, to verify their methods or answers against the given data. We also found that students worked nearly exclusively in the numbercontext and not with the pictures.\",\n",

      "      \"comment\": \"Summary\\nThe authors begin with a review of why technological literacy is an essential part of school curricula and that the definition of what technological literacy is (and how to measure it) has been difficult for the technology field to find consensus. Also, while technology standards have been disseminated to educators, teachers need to know how to implement activities into their classrooms to meet the standards, and learn ways to incorporate technology into their existing lessons.\\n\\nTherefore, this study explores Elementary School Technology Education (ESTE) in order to determine its value and the technology literacy students attain from ESTE. It is a qualitative study, which used focus groups and classroom observations to collect data. Twenty 5th grade gifted and talented students in a Midwestern magnet school were sampled, 9 girls and 11 boys between the ages of 10-11 made up the sample. No demographic information was reported. One of the researchers for this study is also the classroom teacher.\\n\\nFindings\\nESTE is incorporated throughout the school year within the school\\u2019s curriculum and a detailed account of the technology activities the class undertook is provided within the article. The researcher coded student data to the ITEA Technology Literacy Standards for both the focus groups and classroom observations.\\n\\nFocus groups were held separately for the girls and boys, which the researchers . The boys were more likely to report gender bias with regard to girls\\u2019 capabilities for technological work, and each gender thought more positively of their own group with regard to patience, perseverance and teamwork than the other gender.\\n\\nMany students reported valuing technology education because of their increase in knowledge and the relevance of that knowledge to the real world and the future. The students were curious to learn more about technology and expressed an increased interest in technology careers. Only boys, however, mentioned specific career fields that they were considering pursuing in the future.\\n\\nMany students made connections to other subjects like math and science and thought technology education should be in elementary schools because it helped them with problem solving and could help younger kids better understand other subjects. They also reported an increased awareness of the impact of technology on society and concern for its impact on people, raising a number of ethical considerations about technology development.\\n\\nStudents reported and illustrated an understanding of the design process and how to apply it to their activities as well as other subject areas, their ability to use higher level thought processes, such as analysis and evaluation, and reduced fear and apprehension of exploring the unknown (whether conceptually or using new technology/electronics). Students reported the value of learning technology education early on in life so that adults have a stronger foundation.\\n\\nClassroom observations were conducted over a six-month period and the researcher/teacher ranked each student\\u2019s performance against the ITEA Technology Content Standards. Students were assigned the ranking of novice/beginner level, apprentice/developing level or researcher/accomplished level for each standard. It is difficult to say how valid these rankings are given that we have no pre/post tests and the students were assessed by their teacher rather than an objective assessor. However, none of the students are ever ranked below about a 2.3 and often fall between 2.5-2.8ish. As well, girls ranked above the boys on every standard.\\n\\nImplications for EiE\\nThe quality of the research is in question given that the researcher was also the classroom observer and ranker of the students\\u2019 technological literacy. It was not made clear as to whether the teacher was also the researcher who conducted the focus groups. As well, while many focus group questions are listed in the article, few are mentioned in the results and most of the findings section is devoted to gender differences.\\n\\nVery little attention is given to the classroom observation ranking results, and with no pre/post testing it is difficult to know how valuable the rankings are. As well, it is interesting that gender was discussed to such a great extent throughout the paper and then not much at all within the classroom observations even though the female students ranked higher in all standards.\\n\\nWhat was clear from the student quotes throughout the article is that students were very engaged by the activities and wanted more of the same in future classes. EiE may be able to incorporate some of the article\\u2019s content into our own papers about students wishing they had experienced technology education in earlier grades because it would have helped them problem solve more easily.\\n\\nIt might be interesting to develop a ranking system like the one used for this study (novice/apprentice/researcher), and have our teachers rank their students\\u2019 learning on the objectives for each lesson within the units. Or have our teachers plot their own growth following PD experiences, implementing the units within their classrooms, etc.\\nGT\",\n",
